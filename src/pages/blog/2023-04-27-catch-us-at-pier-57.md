The Coding Space is excited to offer free coding classes to kids and families at [Pier 57](https://pier57nyc.com/) on the second Saturday of the month from 1-3PM!

\
Developed by [Google](https://blog.google/inside-google/life-at-google/pier-57-new-york-opens-to-public/) in partnership with Hudson River Park Trust, Jamestown, The James Beard Foundation, RXR, YoungWoo & Associates and Baupost Group, Pier 57 is a new culinary, recreational, and educational destination that celebrates the vitality of New York City and its diverse local community. And now, with The Coding Space's partnership, it is also a place for families to learn and explore coding together.

As a community of coders and educators, we’re passionate about teaching kids the skills they need to thrive in the digital world. Our partnership with Pier 57 is a fantastic opportunity for kids and families in the New York area to start or continue on their coding journey, and we’re thrilled to be able to make coding education more accessible and inclusive in the city we call home.
