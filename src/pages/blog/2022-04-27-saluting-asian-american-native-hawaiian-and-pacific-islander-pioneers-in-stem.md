      # Jerry Yang


      ### FOUNDER OF YAHOO


      Jerry Yang was born in Taipei and immigrated to the United States in 1978. When Yang was 10, the only English word he knew was “shoe”.  “We got made fun of a lot at first,” Yang told [Fortune magazine](https://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2000/03/06/275253/index.htm) about his experience growing up in the US. “I didn’t even know who the faces were on the paper money.” But Yang mastered English in just three years, graduated first in his high school class, and enrolled at Stanford, where he acquired both his bachelor’s and his master’s degree in just four years.


      In 1995, when Yang was partway through his PhD, he-co founded Yahoo! with a fellow Stanford grad student. Yahoo! was an overnight sensation. Before the dawn of search engines, it functioned as a directory—and a guide—to the amorphous and often intimidating Web, making the internet feel manageable for millions of users. After serving as Yahoo’s CEO, Yang departed to seek new challenges in 2012. He is currently investing in the next generation of technologies at his firm [AME Cloud Ventures](http://www.amecloudventures.com/), where he has supported space travel, longevity research, and more than 50 startups. To this day, Jerry Yang is credited with fomenting an Internet revolution, making the World Wide Web friendly to a broad range of everyday users — not just tech experts.

      # Reshma Saujani


      ### FOUNDER OF GIRLSWHOCODE


      Reshma Saujani is the founder of [Girls Who Code](https://girlswhocode.com/), a visionary nonprofit on a mission to close the gender gap in technology and cultivate the next generation of tech superstars. Saujani began her career as an attorney and Democratic organizer; in 2010, she became the first Indian American woman to run for U.S. Congress. During her Congressional campaign, Reshma visited local schools and witnessed the gender gap in computing classes firsthand, which led her to start Girls Who Code. Today, Girls Who Code has taught computer science to 300,000 girls and reached 500 million people worldwide through its New York Times-bestselling book series.

      # Barbara Liskov


      ### THE ARCHITECT OF MODERN ALGORITHMS


      Barbara Liskov pioneered the modern approach to writing code. When she was still a young professor at MIT, she led the team that created the first programming language that did not rely on “goto” statements. The language, CLU (short for “cluster”), relied on an approach she invented — data abstraction — that organized code into modules. Every important programming language used today, including Java and C++, is a descendant of CLU. In 2008, [Liskov won the Turing Award](http://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/liskov_1108679.cfm) for her contributions to programming language and system design.

      # John von Neumann


      ### THE FATHER OF THE MODERN COMPUTER


      John von Neumann, who is widely regarded as one of the foremost mathematicians of his time, pioneered Game Theory and was one of the conceptual inventors of the stored-program digital computer. Among his many accomplishments, the Hungarian-born American mathematician was the originator of the basic principle of computer design known as the "[von Neumann architecture](https://www.computerscience.gcse.guru/theory/von-neumann-architecture)." Von Neumann computers are the ancestors of today's desktop and laptop PCs.


      The principal feature of a von Neumann computer is that the program and any data are both stored together, usually in a slow-to-access storage medium such as a hard disk, and transferred as required to a faster storage medium (RAM) for execution or processing by a central processing unit (CPU). When von Neumann proposed this architecture in 1945, it was a radical idea. Today, practically all computers work this way.

      # Leonard Adelman


      ### THE FOUNDING FATHER OF DNA COMPUTING


      Without doubt, Leonard Adleman’s most famous work is his contribution to the RSA algorithm — the most widely-used contemporary encryption method, with applications throughout the Internet to secure on-line transactions. In recent years, however, Adleman has focused on the interface between biology and computation; for this work, he has been named the “Father of DNA Computation”. Adelman noticed that, like a computer, DNA can store information and proteins can modify that information. He hypothesized that, theoretically, DNA should be able to compute anything that is computable by silicon-based computers. In a jaw-dropping experiment, Adleman used DNA to solve an instance of the [Sharp Satisfiability Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharp-SAT), one of the central problems of computer science.

      the amazing contributions of Jewish Americans in the tech sector. But
      while it’s undeniable that Jewish American coders have shaped modern
      computing, it’s also important to acknowledge that the contributions of
      the Jewish American community range far and wide: a Hall of Fame packed
      with Nobel Prize winners, dramatists, musicians, artists, business
      leaders, movie moguls, educators,  journalists, and educators who have
      enriched and advanced American society. To learn more about Jewish

Here at The Coding Space, the month of May isn’t just a time for spring blooms and summer anticipation — it’s also Asian American, Native Hawaiian, & Pacific Islander Heritage Month. Celebrated each May, [AA & NH/PI Heritage Month](https://asianpacificheritage.gov/) is an awesome opportunity to spotlight the accomplishments of these individuals in STEM and re-commit to disrupting the “model minority” myths that unjustly sabotage their visibility in tech. While Asian Americans are well-represented in the rank and file tech workforce, they are severely underrepresented at executive levels. In fact, Asian American tech professionals are the [least likely racial group](https://hbr.org/2018/05/asian-americans-are-the-least-likely-group-in-the-u-s-to-be-promoted-to-management) to be promoted into leadership roles, even though they are the most likely to be hired into technical roles — a phenomenon often referred to as the [bamboo ceiling](https://www.alliant.edu/blog/bamboo-ceiling-asian-americans-and-myth-model-minority).

Asian Americans, Native Hawaiians, and Pacific Islanders are leaders in every area of STEM. The efforts and breakthroughs of AA & NH/PI coders have revolutionized — and continue to revolutionize — how we connect to each other via technology. Below, we’ve highlighted just four of the countless AA & NH/PI tech professionals who have ensured a more colorful, more connected, and more just world.
