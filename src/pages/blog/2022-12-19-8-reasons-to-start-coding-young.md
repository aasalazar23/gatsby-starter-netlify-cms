In our increasingly digital world, lots of parents want their kids to become computer-literate — and why shouldn’t they? The question is, when should they start learning?

According to [Harvard](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/inbrief-science-of-ecd/), the younger the better.

As it turns out, most professional programmers started learning their trade early in life. According to Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developers survey, over 54 percent of professional developers had written their first line of code by the time they turned 16. And while it might seem intuitive to start your child coding in high school, kids can start coding at a much younger age, sometimes as early as four years old.

Like learning any language, we seem to pick up and integrate what we learn with the greatest ease and fluency at an early age. Not to mention, learning to code as a kid positively affects brain processes, and the results spill over into other aspects of life.
