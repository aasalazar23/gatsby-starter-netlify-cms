      ## 1. Coding boosts problem-solving skills


      Coders are constantly asked to solve tricky problems, learning to tackle complex or novel challenges in creative, efficient ways. The process of coding requires young STEM-heads to break issues down into more manageable sub-problems, then progress through an iterative process of identifying, prioritizing, and implementing solutions. Because of all this, kids start honing their problem-solving skills as soon as they take on their first coding challenge.

      ## 2. Coding improves computational thinking


      Most kids are never taught the underlying logical principles of math, or shown math’s broader applicability in the wide, wonderful world. So, to them, math can seem boring, overly abstract, and unrelatable. One of the great things about coding is that, while kids don’t need to be math experts to get started, they will naturally learn mathematical principles as they code — a mindset we like to call “computational thinking.” Coding allows kids to interact with and visualize the abstract principles of math, instead of just engaging with dry, intimidating digits on paper.

      ## 3. Coding teaches communication skills


      Because computers can only understand direct, simple instructions, tinkering with code naturally develops your ability to express yourself clearly & concisely. In fact, learning to code has many of the cognitive benefits of learning a new language!

In our increasingly digital world, lots of parents want their kids to become computer-literate — and why shouldn’t they? The question is, when should they start learning?

According to [Harvard](https://developingchild.harvard.edu/resources/inbrief-science-of-ecd/), the younger the better.

As it turns out, most professional programmers started learning their trade early in life. According to Stack Overflow’s 2020 Developers survey, over 54 percent of professional developers had written their first line of code by the time they turned 16. And while it might seem intuitive to start your child coding in high school, kids can start coding at a much younger age, sometimes as early as four years old.

Like learning any language, we seem to pick up and integrate what we learn with the greatest ease and fluency at an early age. Not to mention, learning to code as a kid positively affects brain processes, and the results spill over into other aspects of life.
