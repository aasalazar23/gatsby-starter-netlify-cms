With the start of the fall semester come three-day weekends, school holidays, and school breaks. Sometimes, those days off from school can be a welcome respite from relentless academic pressure – but more often than not, kids barely make it halfway through the day before they admit, “I’m bored.” So why not bust those boredom blues by spending those occasional days off at The Coding Space?
