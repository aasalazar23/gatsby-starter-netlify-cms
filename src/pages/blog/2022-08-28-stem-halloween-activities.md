      ## Scary Slime


      *Ages: 4-8*


      This [hands-on activity](https://www.education.com/activity/article/spooky-slime/) is perfect for tactile learners, and it can also provide a welcome break from the overwhelm of Halloween candy. Get (manageably) messy and get creative with sparkles, slime, glitter, and googly eyes as you concoct supernatural slime!

      ## 2. Learn on the job


      STEM internships can give high schoolers a chance to learn the ins & outs of a STEM career first-hand. Check out some local tech companies & STEM start-ups to see if they have high school internship programs. Who knows? Maybe your teenager will write an amazing college essay about how they discovered their love of coding during their summer at Verizon!

      ## 4. Enroll in a STEM competition


      Have a high schooler at home who loves to win? Try signing them up for a STEM competition! From local science fairs to state-level math competitions to national robotics contests, teens can put their minds to the test devising creative solutions to global problems while expanding their STEM horizons and meeting other students with a passion for STEM.

      ## 5. Introduce them to non-traditional STEM careers


      Not every high schooler wants to be a lifelong lab rat – but your teenager shouldn’t let that dissuade them from exploring STEM studies! If your teen loves sports, show them an article about sports statisticians. If they love Fortnite, ask them if they know about video game developers. If they’re a visual artist, hand them an interview with a Pixar animator. The STEM field is broad, and it can accommodate a huge range of personalities and interests!
