      We were blown away by these young coders’ creativity, technical expertise,
      and passion for finding unique coding solutions to real-world problems. As
      a reward, we’ve donated $50 in each category winner’s name to a charitable
      organization embodying the spirit of Code 4 Change. 


      This challenge may be over, but your child’s coding education doesn’t have to stop here. Our summer programming is just around the corner with week-to-week in-person [summer coding camps](https://www.thecodingspace.com/programs/summer-camps/) well as weekly in-person and online [summer classes](https://www.thecodingspace.com/classes). Plus, now is a great time to register, as we’re offering 15% off until May 15th with promo code CODEINSUMMER22.


      We hope our brilliant coders will take advantage of all they’ve learned during Code 4 Change and continue putting their programming powers to work for good. We look forward to seeing their creativity in action again during our next Code 4 Change initiative! Until then — code on.
