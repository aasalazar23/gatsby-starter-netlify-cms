Dear Families,

 

In a world where AI and technological advancements are not just making headlines but reshaping our everyday lives, we face a pivotal choice - to be mere spectators of the digital revolution or to actively engage and harness its vast potential. At The Coding Space, we are committed to empowering our students to choose the latter, equipping them with not just the tools but the reason and judgment to use those tools responsibly. 

\
Understanding and mastering AI, along with other complex technological subjects, begins with a strong foundational knowledge. This is precisely what we cultivate at The Coding Space. Our classrooms are vibrant hubs of critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving. Through engaging projects in Scratch, WoofJS, or Web Development, we not only teach programming fundamentals but also encourage students to think independently and confidently. Our dedicated teachers guide students on their individual journeys, prompting them with thought-provoking questions and encouraging them to explore and discover solutions on their own.

\
This spring, we are thrilled to elevate our curriculum with the introduction of a new Python branch for our advanced learners. Once students have mastered Scratch and WoofJS in our Beginner and Intermediate classes, they will have the option to embark on an exciting new chapter with Python in our Advanced class. This addition is particularly significant given Python's extensive application in AI and data science – fields that are shaping our future – and it will include exposure to algorithms and data. Our advanced coders also will learn to use AI tools to help them debug their code and build their vocabulary. At The Coding Space we've always encouraged students to search the web for answers to their questions, and we view these tools as simply a more efficient version of that effort. (You can read our policy on how and when we use AI tools [here](https://www.thecodingspace.com/custom/teaching-with-ai/).)

\
We invite you to join us this spring for an enriching journey into the world of computing. Let's prepare our children not just to be navigators but leaders in the digital age. Get ready to code the future at The Coding Space!

 

Warmly,

Maddy Carter
