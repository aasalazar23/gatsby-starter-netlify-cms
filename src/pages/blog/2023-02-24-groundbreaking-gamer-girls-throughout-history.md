      ## Mabel Addis Mergardt


      **Company:** Atari


      **Game:** The Sumerian Game


      For most of her life, Addis was a teacher dedicated to her love of history: she wrote historical articles and books and cultivated a love of history in the young minds she encountered. Then, in the 1960s, she was elected to work with IBM to create an educational game for her students.


      \

      What resulted was a text-based strategy game called [The Sumerian Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumerian_Game), the first-ever video game created for a computer, making Addis the first person (not the first woman — the first PERSON!) to write a computer video game. It’s important that we mention the date here — The Sumerian Game was released in 1964. 1964! That’s almost a full decade before either Pong or The Oregon Trail came onto the scene — both games that are often, erroneously, cited as the first computer video games.


      \

      Addis poured her historical passion and expertise into The Sumerian Game, setting it in Lagash a Mesopotamian city in the year 3500 BC, and casting the player as the ruler, who must decide how much grain to feed their people, what to do about rat infestations, and how much of their city’s funds to dedicate to land expansion. The first players of Addis’s groundbreaking game? Her students, of course!

      ## Valerie Thomas


      Valerie Thomas had a strong interest in technology early on but didn’t receive support for it until she attended Morgan State University. She was one of only two women in her class to major in physics. She excelled at school and landed a job as a mathematical/data analyst for NASA. She worked at NASA from 1964 to 1995, conducting large-scale experiments, developing computer data systems, and most notably, spearheading the development of the first satellite to send images from space, “[Landsat](https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/valerie-thomas).” The technology she developed is still used by NASA today.

      ## Clarence "Skip" Ellis


      [Clarence “Skip” Ellis](https://cs.illinois.edu/news/memory-clarence-skip-ellis-1943-2014) was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. in computer science. He had a long career at major tech companies like Bell Telephone Laboratories, IBM, Xerox, and more. At the Palo Alto Research Center, Ellis spearheaded a group that invented Officetalk: the first office system to use icons and ethernet to allow people to collaborate from a distance. Ellis was also a real pioneer in the field of operational transformation, which is found in modern collaborative apps like Google Docs. For all of these accomplishments, Ellis is (sometimes, cheekily) known as the Father of Remote Work.

      ## Marc Regis Hannah


      For the graphics in Jurassic Park, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and more, we have electrical engineer and computer graphics designer [Marc Regis Hannah](https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/marc-hannah-41) to thank. In 1982 Hannah co-founded Silicon Graphics, Inc., eventually becoming the company’s principal scientist. His computer graphics technology has been used in major motion films as well as commercials, the intro for Monday Night Football, and by George Lucas’s visual effects studio, Industrial Light & Magic.

      ## Lisa Gelobter


      Lisa Gelobter graduated from Brown at the age of 20 with a computer science degree and a concentration in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After working as the Chief Digital Officer for BET Networks and launching Hulu (Hulu!), Gelobter also served as the Chief Digital Service Officer for the U.S. Department of Education during the administration of President Barack Obama. Never one to rest on her laurels, in 2016, Gelobter founded and became the Chief Executive Officer of tEQuitable, a company that provides an independent, confidential platform to address issues of bias, harassment, and discrimination in the workplace.

If you’ve believed up to this point that video games are primarily the purview of gamer dudes, we don’t blame you. Video gaming IS (and has historically been) a male-dominated industry. That being said, the history of video gaming is probably less bro-heavy than you’ve been led to believe.

It’s unfortunate, but true: the many women who shaped the video game industry often go unacknowledged, hidden from popular narratives by male-centric scholarship and harmful “lone genius” myths. This year, for Women’s History Month, we’re aiming to set the record straight by shedding light on some of the most iconic, most influential, and most overlooked gamer girls throughout history.
