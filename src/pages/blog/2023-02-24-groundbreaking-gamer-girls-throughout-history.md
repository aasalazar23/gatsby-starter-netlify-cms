      ## Mabel Addis Mergardt


      **Company:** Atari


      **Game:** The Sumerian Game


      For most of her life, Addis was a teacher dedicated to her love of history: she wrote historical articles and books and cultivated a love of history in the young minds she encountered. Then, in the 1960s, she was elected to work with IBM to create an educational game for her students.


      \

      What resulted was a text-based strategy game called [The Sumerian Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sumerian_Game), the first-ever video game created for a computer, making Addis the first person (not the first woman — the first PERSON!) to write a computer video game. It’s important that we mention the date here — The Sumerian Game was released in 1964. 1964! That’s almost a full decade before either Pong or The Oregon Trail came onto the scene — both games that are often, erroneously, cited as the first computer video games.


      \

      Addis poured her historical passion and expertise into The Sumerian Game, setting it in Lagash a Mesopotamian city in the year 3500 BC, and casting the player as the ruler, who must decide how much grain to feed their people, what to do about rat infestations, and how much of their city’s funds to dedicate to land expansion. The first players of Addis’s groundbreaking game? Her students, of course!

      ## Carol Shaw


      **Companies:** Atari & Activision


      **Games:** 3D Tic-Tac-Toe, Othello, Video Checkers, Super Breakout, River Raid, and Happy Trails


      \

      Shaw was one of the very first women to design and program video games and is often considered to be the first \*professional\* female video game designer. Working at Atari and Activision over an astounding career that spanned decades, she designed skillful, innovative games that left the industry flabbergasted. She's most well-known for River Raid, which sold over a million copies and established top-down shooters as a lucrative and popular genre of their own. Even today, River Raid is recognized as a masterpiece of its time, an astonishing amount of programming skill crammed into a 4KB game that offered endless hours of entertainment. In 2017, Shaw won the Industry Icon Award for her massive impact on the gaming industry.

      ## Dona Bailey


      **Company:** Atari


      **Game:** Centipede


      Dona Bailey is yet another “first” — the first woman to create an arcade game! When she accepted a position at [Atari](https://www.atariwomen.org/stories/dona-bailey/) in 1980, she was the only female game designer at the company. While there, she created the classic arcade hit​ Centipede — one of the most commercially successful arcade games during the arcade golden age. She is especially well-known for insisting on excellent visuals in the game; she meticulously wrote additional code to populate the screen with colorful mushrooms and random spiders that crawl across the screen, enhancing the game’s immersive quality.In 2013, Bailey was awarded the Women in Gaming Lifetime Achievement Award.

      ## Marc Regis Hannah


      For the graphics in Jurassic Park, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and more, we have electrical engineer and computer graphics designer [Marc Regis Hannah](https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/marc-hannah-41) to thank. In 1982 Hannah co-founded Silicon Graphics, Inc., eventually becoming the company’s principal scientist. His computer graphics technology has been used in major motion films as well as commercials, the intro for Monday Night Football, and by George Lucas’s visual effects studio, Industrial Light & Magic.

If you’ve believed up to this point that video games are primarily the purview of gamer dudes, we don’t blame you. Video gaming IS (and has historically been) a male-dominated industry. That being said, the history of video gaming is probably less bro-heavy than you’ve been led to believe.

It’s unfortunate, but true: the many women who shaped the video game industry often go unacknowledged, hidden from popular narratives by male-centric scholarship and harmful “lone genius” myths. This year, for Women’s History Month, we’re aiming to set the record straight by shedding light on some of the most iconic, most influential, and most overlooked gamer girls throughout history.
