      # Alan Turing


      We’ll start with the kingpin — the beloved and widely renowned father of computer science, Alan Turing. In the mid 1930s, Turing devised the idea for a universal machine that could decode and action a set of instructions; this Turing machine, as it came to be known, precedes the digital computers we use today. A graduate of Cambridge and Princeton, Turing worked as a cryptanalyst during World War II, when he designed and created a code-breaking system called the [Bombe](https://www.tnmoc.org/bombe). The Bombe was so adept at deciphering the so-called unbreakable German codes that historians now say Turing effectively shortened the war by as much as [four years](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691). In his work after the war, Turing developed the idea of artificial computer intelligence and devised an experiment to test AI’s ability to think like a human being, which is still referred to today as the “[Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).”

      # Christopher Strachey


      After an early career as a physicist and teacher, Christopher Strachey transitioned into computer programming, where he made a name for himself by blending computer science and art. When he was still a total novice, Strachey, over the course of a single evening, wrote one of the first computer music programs, which played “Baa Baa Black Sheep” on the [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1). In 1952, by which time he was an accomplished programmer, Strachey developed a love-letter generator that ran on the Manchester Mark 1 using a random number generating algorithm. These projects are widely regarded as the first examples of algorithmic or computational art. Strachey is also remembered as one of the developers of [Combined Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPL_(programming_language)) (CPL), an early precursor to the influential C programming language.

      # Edie Windsor


      Edith Windsor is well-known as the queer rights activist whose victory in the landmark Supreme Court case [United States v. Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor) helped overturn DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act), giving federal recognition to same-sex couples for the first time. Windsor filed the lawsuit after she was unable to claim a tax exemption left to her by her late spouse, as the term “spouse” referred only to heterosexual couples at the time. What’s less well known, however, are Wilson’s contributions as a computer scientist. Windsor worked at IBM for 16 years and achieved the highest technical position at the time, Senior Systems Programmer. Praised especially for her “top-notch debugging skills,” Windsor founded the consulting firm PC Classics after leaving IBM, where she made a point to provide tech educations for queer groups.

      # Jon "Maddog" Hall


      Jon “Maddog” Hall is the board chair for [The Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/) and a vocal champion of free and open-source software. Prior to this, Hall was head of the computer science department at [Hartford State Technical College](https://www.capitalcc.edu/about/), where his temper earned him the nickname “Maddog.” On Alan Turing’s 100th birth anniversary, Hall wrote an [article](https://www.linux-magazine.com/content/view/full/55727) in Linux magazine, in which he came out as gay and called Turing his hero: “\[Turing] did so much for the industry with which I have spent the last 42 years of my life.”

      # Mary Ann Horton


      Mary Ann Horton is a computer scientist and transgender activist. She is one of the principal founders and designers of [Usenet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#:~:text=Usenet%20(%2F%CB%88ju%CB%90z,it%20was%20established%20in%201980.>), a precursor to the modern Internet that is still in use today. Horton also invented uuencode, which was the forerunner to email attachments. In addition to her contributions to technology, Horton has also made significant contributions to transgender rights in the workplace. In 1997, she asked her then employer [Lucent Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent) to include the language “gender identity, characteristics, or expression” in its Equal Opportunity (EO) policy, which led to Lucent becoming the first company in the United States to add transgender-inclusive language to its EO policy.

      # Audrey Tang


      Audrey Tang is a nonbinary transgender software developer and self-described “civic hacker” who was appointed as Taiwan’s official Digital Minister in 2016. Tang is the youngest and first transgender official in Taiwan’s executive government. As Digital Minister, Tang is the force behind Taiwan’s tech-based COVID-19 response: promoting an open source website for finding shops with masks in stock, developing a vaccination reservation system, and creating an anonymous contact tracing system. Born in Taiwan, Audrey Tang is a self-taught programmer who was learning Perl at the age of 12, launching a startup at 15, and working in Silicon Valley by 19. A programming wunderkind, Tang is well-known for leading the [Pugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs_(programming)) project to develop the Perl 6 language, starting the [Perl Archive Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Archive_Toolkit) (PAT), and their role as an outspoken advocate for free software and an open web.

      # Dr. Mary Gray


      The author of two books and co-editor of another, queer-identifying [Mary Gray](http://marylgray.org/?page_id=6) is currently a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research, a Fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society, and a faculty member at Indiana University. Gray, an anthropologist and media scholar, focuses on how people’s everyday uses of technologies transform labor, identity, and human rights. In 2020, Gray was named a [MacArthur Fellow](https://youtu.be/RsgtRVI_yhM) for her contributions to the study of technology, digital economies, and society. Her recent research has focused on “ghost work” (i.e., [contract labor such as crowdsourcing](http://www.inthecrowd.org/) and the impact of automation on on-demand economies). Dr. Gray chairs the [Microsoft Research Ethics Review Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/microsoft-research-ethics-review-program-irb/) and is recognized as a leading expert in the emerging field of AI and ethics.

      # Wysa


      ### Founder: Jo Aggarwal


      [Wysa](https://www.wysa.io/), a mental health app powered by artificial intelligence, connects users with an anonymous, free, clinically assured AI mental wellness coach. Founder Jo Aggarwal designed Wysa to help compensate for the scarcity of therapists across the globe – even in countries with a relatively high therapist-to-population ratio, like the US, some therapists still have a year’s worth of patients on a waiting list. Aggarwal also emphasizes that the app is not a replacement for human therapy, but rather an additional tool for users who aren’t yet sure that they need therapy or don’t currently have access to a professional therapist. Wysa uses evidence-based cognitive-behavioral techniques (CBT), DBT, meditation, breathing, yoga, motivational interviewing and micro-actions to help you build mental resilience skills and, above all, feel better.

Happy Pride Month! We’re stopping in this month to tell you all about the queer history of computing. You probably know a few of the famous LGBTQIA2+ tech pioneers — like Alan Turing and Tim Cook — but we bet you haven’t heard about all 10 of the individuals below whose life work played an integral role in the development of modern computer technology. Many of these individuals lived and worked in an era when social pressures (or even laws) required them to hide their true identities—which makes it all the more fitting that we celebrate them today.
