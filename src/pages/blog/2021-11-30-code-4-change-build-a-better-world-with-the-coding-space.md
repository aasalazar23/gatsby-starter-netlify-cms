          ["Code 4 Change Charity Quiz"](https://code4change.thecodingspace.com/1620445272119)


          **About the Project:** “This is a quiz to determine which charity to donate to based on how you answer the questions.”\

          \

          **From the Judges:** *India's cleanly designed quiz helps you to find the best charities for helping with the causes you care about most. We were impressed by how clean the design of the project was overall, as well as her use of the UN Sustainable Goal icons. Making a project in Scratch that looks this good isn't easy, and India clearly didn't cut any corners!*
