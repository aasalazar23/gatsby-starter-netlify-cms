      ## Social Media


      Look: social media deserves a lot of the criticism it gets. But the prevailing benefit of those platforms is that they connect people around the world. And a [2015 study](https://money.usnews.com/money/careers/slideshows/10-ways-social-media-can-help-you-land-a-job) revealed that 52% of employers use social networking sites to research job candidates. Social media is here to stay for the foreseeable future, and it doesn’t have to just be a distraction. From designing face filters as an AR designer, to developing the software of social platforms, to building social apps from scratch as a mobile app developer – if your child or teen loves social media, there are plenty of tech careers that can grow out of that interest.

A regular coding class, though, offers students a fun, motivating, and creative opportunity to learn how to move through the inevitable setbacks of programming.

      ## 5. Coding bolsters communication skills


      Because computers can only understand direct, simple instructions, tinkering with code naturally develops a child’s ability to express themselves clearly & concisely. This is a great skill for kids to build as they take on the increasing academic and organizational demands of middle & high school.
