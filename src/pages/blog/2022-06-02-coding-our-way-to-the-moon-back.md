On July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy, propelling Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin into space and into history. Much has been said and written about the bold astronauts and rocket scientists who made this momentous mission possible. But we’d also like to take a moment to celebrate — you guessed it — the code of it all. 

Apollo 11's original source code was developed by computer programmers at MIT in the '60s, led by coding legend Margaret Hamilton. This code was the backbone of the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer) (AGC), which astronauts used to navigate and control the spacecraft.

Without the computers on board the Apollo spacecraft, there would have been no moon landing, no triumphant first step, no high-water mark for human space travel. A human pilot could never have manually navigated the way to the moon, as if the spaceship were simply a more powerful airplane. The calculations required to make in-flight adjustments and the complexity of the thrust controls outstripped human computing capacities.

Lucky us: this all-important source code for Apollo 11’s flight computer software was posted i[n its entirety](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11) to [Github](https://github.com/), a collaborative platform for developers, in 2016. In honor of the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, we’ve highlighted below some of the most thrilling and surprising aspects of the code that took us to the moon.
