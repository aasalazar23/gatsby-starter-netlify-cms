      # No bugs here


      Margaret Hamilton, the MIT computer programmer who led the team that created the onboard Apollo software, was an unbelievably capable and precise programmer. As [The Guardian noted in an interview](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jul/13/margaret-hamilton-computer-scientist-interview-software-apollo-missions-1969-moon-landing-nasa-women) with her, “Her rigorous approach was so successful that no software bugs were ever known to have occurred during any crewed Apollo missions.”


      No software bugs! It’s incredibly rare for any code — let alone code as complex as the one powering the AGC — to be completely bug-free. Even today, mega-tech companies like Microsoft, Google, and Meta unofficially celebrate “Patch Tuesday” every month, when they release software patches to fix the bugs in their code. Now, we here at The Coding Space aren’t about to judge coding mistakes — we love mistakes for their irreplaceable educational value. That being said, the creation of a bug-less code managed by Hamilton and her team is still a feat worthy of admiration.

      # Anything but "Sirius"


      In programming, developers often leave comments throughout their code to describe to readers what the code is supposed to do. However, it’s obvious that the Apollo 11 programmers did more than that. Combing through the AGC source code, coding enthusiasts have found all sorts of easter eggs, consisting of playful messages, puns, and pop culture references. For example, the name for the file responsible for the spacecraft’s main ignition routine is titled "BURN_BABY_BURN," And the file responsible for the spaceship’s keyboard display system is called "PINBALL_GAME_BUTTONS_AND_LIGHTS".

      Shakespeare’s Henry V. Even cheekier, there’s a comment in the code
      directing the user to check and make sure the astronauts aren’t lying
      about following the appropriate commands. There are jokes and secret
      messages tucked in every corner of the code: it's obvious that the
      original developers had a lot of fun writing this code, and we have a lot
      of fun reading it!"

On July 16, 1969, Apollo 11 launched from Cape Kennedy, propelling Commander Neil Armstrong, Command Module Pilot Michael Collins, and Lunar Module Pilot Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin into space and into history. Much has been said and written about the bold astronauts and rocket scientists who made this momentous mission possible. But we’d also like to take a moment to celebrate — you guessed it — the code of it all. 

Apollo 11's original source code was developed by computer programmers at MIT in the '60s, led by coding legend Margaret Hamilton. This code was the backbone of the [Apollo Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer) (AGC), which astronauts used to navigate and control the spacecraft.

Without the computers on board the Apollo spacecraft, there would have been no moon landing, no triumphant first step, no high-water mark for human space travel. A human pilot could never have manually navigated the way to the moon, as if the spaceship were simply a more powerful airplane. The calculations required to make in-flight adjustments and the complexity of the thrust controls outstripped human computing capacities.

Lucky us: this all-important source code for Apollo 11’s flight computer software was posted i[n its entirety](https://github.com/chrislgarry/Apollo-11) to [Github](https://github.com/), a collaborative platform for developers, in 2016. In honor of the anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing, we’ve highlighted below some of the most thrilling and surprising aspects of the code that took us to the moon.
