**Where are you from?** \
AM: San Antonio, Texas. Home of the Alamo, Tex Mex food, and the San Antonio Spurs!

\
**Where do you live now?**\
AM: Manhattan, right in the heart of New York City.

\
**Any pets?**\
AM: I have a 1.5 year old Blue Heeler who loves going to the park and playing in the snow! 

\
**Favorite food?**\
AM: Nachos, hands down! I’m from Texas, so anything with queso.

\
**Karaoke song of choice?**\
AM: “Our Song” by Taylor Swift

\
**Before working at TCS, what was the most unusual job you had?**\
AM: It’s a tie. Once, I worked in a biochemistry lab at a medical school that was two stories underground, down the hall from where they kept cadavers. I also used to be a competitive figure skater! 

\
**What drew you to TCS?** \
AM: How the program welcomes any student who wants to learn coding, whether they are experienced or just getting started. Computer programming classes aren’t always available in schools — but if we want to set students up for success, all students need to understand coding. 

\
**What is your favorite part of working at TCS?** \
AM: The people! Everyone is so passionate about creating the best possible programming for our students. And, of course, I love working with the students and witnessing their “lightbulb” moments.

\
**Why coding? What experience do you have with coding/why do you like it?** \
AM: I took my very first coding class in high school, where I remember programming “Hello World!” for the first time. I later went on to pursue a degree in Mechanical Engineering with a focus in Robotics. I like coding for its versatility. You can use code to control a robot, to create self-driving cars or apps — the possibilities are endless! 

\
**Who is your computer programming or STEM idol?**\
AM: I really look up to Emily Calandrelli! She is one of the few female science TV-show hosts, demonstrating that there’s no one way to be a STEM professional.
