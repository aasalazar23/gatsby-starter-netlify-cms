      ## Ajay Bhatt


      *Co-Inventor of USB Technology*


      In today’s world, where tech is increasingly connected by Bluetooth and WiFi and wires are fast disappearing, it’s easy to forget the key technologies that got us here. But even for those of us who have the most cutting-edge tech, it’s difficult to avoid the USB.


      The idea for the USB was born in 1994, [when Ajay Bhatt,](http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/02/04/ajay.bhatt.usb.inventor/index.html) an Indian-born computer architect working for Intel, found himself frustrated by his daughter’s difficulty in connecting a printer to the family computer. Then and there, Bhatt decided that data transfers like the one his daughter needed should be no more difficult than plugging a cord into a wall outlet. After pitching the idea for USB tech to his colleagues at Intel, Bhatt put together a team of experts from Intel and other companies to design a new way of connecting computers. USB transformed how people used computers, becoming one of the most successful, enduring connection technologies in history.

      ## Tony Fadell


      *Father of the iPod*


      When Apple was on the verge of collapse in 2001, they called Arab American inventor [Tony Fadell](https://www.buildc.com/meet-tony). Apple CEO Steve Jobs had imagined a product that could save his company — a personal music player that could put 1000 songs in your pocket. But there was no design, no team, no prototype, and no real traction for the idea. Undeterred, Fadell assembled a team and got to work. The result was the iPod, which launched in November 2001 and revolutionized the entire industry. Fadell oversaw the first 18 iterations of the iPod before Jobs gave him his next assignment: to create a new version of the iPod that also had the capabilities of a mobile phone. You guessed it — the result was the first iPhone, the invention of which was spearheaded by Fadell. After leaving Apple, Fadell has continued inventing and building game-changing personal tech, like the Nest thermostat.

      ## Taher Elgamal


      *The Architect of Internet Security*


      The topic of online privacy and security is dominating the airwaves now, but that wasn’t always the case. However, thanks to early tech visionaries like Egyptian-American Taher Elgamal, developments in internet security and cryptography are rapidly advancing. Elgamal began his pioneering work in the 1980s, before truly anyone else was considering security algorithms. His paper “[A Public Key Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme based on Discrete Logarithms](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39568-7_2),” published in 1984, formed the bases of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and the Advanced Encryption Standard. Additionally, Elgamal was the driving force behind the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a protocol that keeps online communications (like email!) secure.

Though their work is often overlooked, Arab American inventors have made major contributions to American technology. So this month, for Arab American Heritage Month, we’re saying it loud and clear: throughout history, America’s progress in science and tech has been MASSIVELY boosted by the innovations of Arab-American makers and visionaries! Here are just three of our favorite Arab-American tech trailblazers.
