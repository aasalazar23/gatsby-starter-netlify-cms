      ## Granville Woods


      Born in Columbus, Ohio, Granville Woods was a great inventor, specifically known for his 15 different appliances for the electric railways. He was most known for inventing the [multiplex “induction telegraph,”](https://airespring.com/unsung-heroes-of-telecom-granville-t-woods/) which allowed for voice communication through telegraph wires and prevented many train accidents. He became known as “Black Edison” because Thomas Edison tried to sue Woods after he invented the multiplex telegraph. The lawsuit failed, so Edison tried to make Woods a partner, but he refused. Woods held nearly 60 patents at the time of his death.

      ## Valerie Thomas


      Valerie Thomas had a strong interest in technology early on but didn’t receive support for it until she attended Morgan State University. She was one of only two women in her class to major in physics. She excelled at school and landed a job as a mathematical/data analyst for NASA. She worked at NASA from 1964 to 1995, conducting large-scale experiments, developing computer data systems, and most notably, spearheading the development of the first satellite to send images from space, “[Landsat](https://lemelson.mit.edu/resources/valerie-thomas).” The technology she developed is still used by NASA today.

      ## Octavia Butler


      A multiple recipient of the Hugo Award, Nebula Award, and MacArthur Genius Grant, Octavia Butler’s *Parable of the Sower* and *Parable of the Talents* have been widely recognized for their eerie prescience in predicting contemporary social, ecological, and technological movements — including global warming, the massive influence of tech conglomerates, and the rise of populism in government.

      ## Margaret Atwood


      Margaret Atwood is probably most famous for her novel *The Handmaid’s Tale*, but many of her other novels have predicted the future in their own ways. For example, in *Oryx & Crake*, she imagines a world in which scientists can engineer bioluminescence in organisms — a technique that currently proliferates among researchers studying gene expression and more — as well as some technology that is currently in the making, like “smart clothes” (shirts that can display your email!)

      ## NK Jemisin


      Because NK Jemisin is a contemporary powerhouse in the science fiction world, the stuff of her novels still seems like magic to readers — but not for long. We’re positive that the richly detailed, visionary world of her celebrated *Broken Earth* trilogy (which incidentally warns against technological hubris) has plentiful details that are already inspiring today’s brightest STEM minds, from floating crystal obelisks to the genetic ability to sense ecological disasters.

Happy Black History Month! Now is not only a time to reflect on the achievements of Black individuals and communities, but also a time to recognize the ongoing struggle for racial equality and social justice. From the earliest days of recorded history, Black scientists, inventors, and mathematicians have been at the forefront of scientific discovery and technological innovation, but their accomplishments have often been erased or dismissed. In order to do our part to engage with the rich history of Black people and to appreciate the massive contributions Black communities have made, we’re spotlighting five pioneering Black innovators who’ve shaped today’s technological landscape and whose legacy continues to inspire future generations of scientists and technologists.
