      ## Mary Shelley


      Considered by many to be the founder of science fiction, Mary Shelley is widely known for penning the monster masterpiece *Frankenstein*. In that novel, she details the use of electricity to animate a lifeless creature. This plot feature was partially inspired by Shelley’s interest in experiments in galvanism (electrical resuscitation); her novel popularized those scientific efforts, which (much later) led to the invention of the defibrillator.

      ## Madeleine L'Engle


      In Madeleine L’Engle’s acclaimed novel *A Wrinkle in Time*, the eponymous wrinkle is a “tesseract” — a type of wormhole in the fifth dimension that allows instantaneous travel across space and time. At the time of that novel’s publication, the idea of a fifth dimension basically only existed in the realm of science fiction. But breakthroughs in physics in the past few decades (including superstring theory) now have scientists arguing that there are probably more than four dimensions, just as L’Engle imagined!

      ## Octavia Butler


      A multiple recipient of the Hugo Award, Nebula Award, and MacArthur Genius Grant, Octavia Butler’s *Parable of the Sower* and *Parable of the Talents* have been widely recognized for their eerie prescience in predicting contemporary social, ecological, and technological movements — including global warming, the massive influence of tech conglomerates, and the rise of populism in government.

      ## Margaret Atwood


      Margaret Atwood is probably most famous for her novel *The Handmaid’s Tale*, but many of her other novels have predicted the future in their own ways. For example, in *Oryx & Crake*, she imagines a world in which scientists can engineer bioluminescence in organisms — a technique that currently proliferates among researchers studying gene expression and more — as well as some technology that is currently in the making, like “smart clothes” (shirts that can display your email!)

      ## NK Jemisin


      Because NK Jemisin is a contemporary powerhouse in the science fiction world, the stuff of her novels still seems like magic to readers — but not for long. We’re positive that the richly detailed, visionary world of her celebrated *Broken Earth* trilogy (which incidentally warns against technological hubris) has plentiful details that are already inspiring today’s brightest STEM minds, from floating crystal obelisks to the genetic ability to sense ecological disasters.

Happy Black History Month! Now is not only a time to reflect on the achievements of Black individuals and communities, but also a time to recognize the ongoing struggle for racial equality and social justice. From the earliest days of recorded history, Black scientists, inventors, and mathematicians have been at the forefront of scientific discovery and technological innovation, but their accomplishments have often been erased or dismissed. In order to do our part to engage with the rich history of Black people and to appreciate the massive contributions Black communities have made, we’re spotlighting five pioneering Black innovators who’ve shaped today’s technological landscape and whose legacy continues to inspire future generations of scientists and technologists.
