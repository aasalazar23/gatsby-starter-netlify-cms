As part of The Coding Space’s commitment to educational equity, we are pleased as punch to announce our newest hire: Sarah Tucci, Head of Scholarship Admissions! Sarah is a bi-continental educator and community activist with a keen interest in advancing technological equity. She comes to us with tons of experience providing data and programmatic support to community initiatives, which comes in handy for her secondary role as TCS’s Online Support Associate. Sarah holds a bachelor's degree in International Politics from Penn State University and is currently working on a Master's degree in Sustainable Cultural Heritage from the American University of Rome. Keep reading to learn more about Sarah, her background, and her appreciation for TCS’s tangible impact in our communities. 



**Where are you from?** 

ST: I’m from Philadelphia — home of cheesesteaks, Rocky and our national treasure, Gritty.



**Where do you live now?**

ST: I split my time between Philadelphia and Rome, Italy.



**Any pets?**

ST: I have a sweet pitbull named Brutus who lives with my parents — seeing him is the reason I come home from Rome!



**Favorite TV shows?**

ST: Star Trek: The Next Generation and Deep Space Nine



**Favorite podcast?**

ST: It’s a tie between “Tides of History” and “Hardcore History”.



**Karaoke song of choice?**

ST: “I’m Not Okay” by My Chemical Romance or “Dancing Queen” by ABBA, depending on the day!



**Who would you want to play you in the movie of your life?**

ST: Definitely Danny DeVito.



**What superpower would you choose?**

ST: Teleportation would be great!



**What drew you to TCS?** 

ST: I love working in education! Professionally, I’ve tended to gravitate towards community based initiatives, including programmatic support for education. My academic background is in Cultural Heritage and International Politics, but I found myself missing the tangible impact that comes with working in education, and I was so lucky to come across The Coding Space! I love how passionate my coworkers are and TCS’s emphasis on inclusivity. 



**What is your favorite part of working at TCS?** 

ST: I love being able to interact with the students and seeing them having fun while they learn about coding — I especially appreciate their reflections at the end of class! It’s also very rewarding to work with scholarship admissions. I love that a part of my work is breaking barriers by helping parents access coding classes for their children!



**What was your first experience with coding?** 

ST: I’m going to date myself with this, but my first foray into coding was with MySpace back in the day — I had fun changing my backgrounds and customizing my page. I love coding because it helps me see problems from new and unexpected perspectives!



**Who is your computer programming or STEM idol?**

ST: Rosalind Franklin. Her research illuminated DNA & RNA structures, which has revolutionized our understanding of the world, ourselves, and many types of investigation and research. She lived a short but extremely impactful life.
