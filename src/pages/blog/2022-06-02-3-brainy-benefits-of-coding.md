      ## Coding activates the brain's learning centers


      According to a [study](https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/journal_contribution/Understanding_Understanding_Source_Code_with_Functional_Magnetic_Resonance_Imaging/6626357) conducted by Dr. Janet Siegmund, one of the world’s foremost programming experts, coding activates five regions of the brain related to language processing, working memory, and problem-solving. Since coding tasks require a range of complex skills, the brain adapts to reinforce associations between distinct parts of the brain. Forming these flexible intra-brain connections is a great workout for the brain, strengthening its ability to learn, memorize, and perform.

      ## Coding improves perception of detail


      Try reading this scrambled text.


      Can you read it? Of course you can! You can make perfect sense of it, even though it’s a total mess. Because our brains don’t perceive individual letters; they perceive words as a whole. This is an AMAZING ability of our brains, but it also means that we’re hard-wired to see the big picture over the nitty gritty details — and successful code depends on the nitty gritty details. You can’t write “string” as “srting”: even though your brain understands what it means, a computer will not. As you code, you train yourself to recognize characters just as well as words and sentences, boosting your brain’s ability to pick up on small details.

Happy World Brain Day! Today is all about promoting brain health, and we at TCS have just the ticket. That’s right: coding! But it isn’t only us who think so. Apple founder Steve Jobs himself said that “Programming teaches you how to think.”

Just as the arts can shape your mind in various ways, coding also gives your brain a boost. Scroll for three science-backed brain benefits of learning to code!
