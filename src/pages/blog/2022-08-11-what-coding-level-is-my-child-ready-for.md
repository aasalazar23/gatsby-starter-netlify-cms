      ## Young Beginner Code


      Young Beginner Code is built specifically for ages 6-8. If your young coder has no coding experience, we’ll likely start them out in code.org, a platform that introduces them to key concepts such as sequence, events, and loops; or ScratchJr, a precursor to Scratch, MIT’s introductory language designed for children. If your child has experience in Scratch already, we’ll likely start them there. Young Beginner classes are 90 minutes and include an offline activity to allow students to take a step back from the screen and reinforce concepts in a different way.

      ## Reading boosts creativity


      When you think about “creativity,” you might first think of the arts – painters, songwriters, designers, poets. But creativity applies to many more fields than just the arts! You are flexing your creativity when you improvise a new recipe, when you offer a new idea in the boardroom, and — yes — when you code! 


      In Why Reading Books Still Matters: The Power of Literature in Digital Times, Martha C. Pennington and Robert P. Waxler state, “If imagination connected to reason spurs discovery, innovation, and new understandings, it can be maintained that literature has a key role in both developing and engaging imaginative and magical thinking.” The ability to create new ideas is crucial in the world of technology, and reading is one of the easiest ways to develop creativity.

      ## Reading enriches your facility with language


      Perhaps most obviously, reading enriches your vocabulary and your mastery of language. Not only does an enhanced vocabulary make it easier for coders to explain their ideas to their fellow programmers, their clients, and their bosses, an expanded vocabulary also allows coders to practice skills critical to their craft — like decoding the composite parts of a language and learning the mechanics of syntax.
