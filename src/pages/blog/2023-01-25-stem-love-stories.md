      ## Marie & Pierre Curie


      There was a time when Pierre Curie thought love was nothing but a distraction from scientific work. Then he met Marie Sklowdoska.


      In 1894, Marie was hard at work in Paris investigating the magnetic properties of certain steels. Her hunt for a larger lab space led her to meet Pierre, who (grudgingly) allowed her to use a piezoelectric device that he’d invented to further her work.


      The two fell in love over their mutual passion for science; but when Pierre proposed, Marie refused him (gasp!) because she wanted to return home to Poland. Marie did go home, but when she was denied a position at Krakow University because she was a woman, she returned to Paris, and Pierre & Marie became spouses & scientific partners. As a married couple, they collaborated on Marie’s new work investigating radioactive elements. In 1903, they won the Nobel Prize in Physics for their discovery of polonium and radium.

      ## **Jerome & Isabella Karle**


      Picture this: an enemies-to-lovers tale about two lab partners who are forced to work together and find more chemistry than they bargained for.


      In 1940, Jerome & Isabella met on their first day of physical chemistry at the University of Michigan. Though they were assigned as lab partners, they were immediate academic rivals, competing for the top grade in the class. But, in addition to covalent bonds, they found themselves nursing a romantic bond — they got married and moved to DC, where they started work on X-ray crystallography together at the US Naval Research Laboratory. While Jerome developed equations to determine how atoms were arranged inside complex molecules, Isabella worked on practical experiments to test Jerome’s equations. Together, they created the [direct method](http://pd.chem.ucl.ac.uk/pdnn/solve1/direct.htm) for determining molecular structures.

      ## Clarence "Skip" Ellis


      [Clarence “Skip” Ellis](https://cs.illinois.edu/news/memory-clarence-skip-ellis-1943-2014) was the first African-American to earn a Ph.D. in computer science. He had a long career at major tech companies like Bell Telephone Laboratories, IBM, Xerox, and more. At the Palo Alto Research Center, Ellis spearheaded a group that invented Officetalk: the first office system to use icons and ethernet to allow people to collaborate from a distance. Ellis was also a real pioneer in the field of operational transformation, which is found in modern collaborative apps like Google Docs. For all of these accomplishments, Ellis is (sometimes, cheekily) known as the Father of Remote Work.

      ## Marc Regis Hannah


      For the graphics in Jurassic Park, Aladdin, Beauty and the Beast, and more, we have electrical engineer and computer graphics designer [Marc Regis Hannah](https://www.thehistorymakers.org/biography/marc-hannah-41) to thank. In 1982 Hannah co-founded Silicon Graphics, Inc., eventually becoming the company’s principal scientist. His computer graphics technology has been used in major motion films as well as commercials, the intro for Monday Night Football, and by George Lucas’s visual effects studio, Industrial Light & Magic.

      ## Lisa Gelobter


      Lisa Gelobter graduated from Brown at the age of 20 with a computer science degree and a concentration in artificial intelligence and machine learning. After working as the Chief Digital Officer for BET Networks and launching Hulu (Hulu!), Gelobter also served as the Chief Digital Service Officer for the U.S. Department of Education during the administration of President Barack Obama. Never one to rest on her laurels, in 2016, Gelobter founded and became the Chief Executive Officer of tEQuitable, a company that provides an independent, confidential platform to address issues of bias, harassment, and discrimination in the workplace.

*"Science is not only a discipline of reason but, also, one of romance and passion." — Stephen Hawking*

It’s Valentine’s Day, and let’s be honest — sometimes, being a STEM lover on Valentine’s Day can seem…well..uncool?

Hollywood and society at large love to depict scientists, mathematicians, and coders as cold, aloof, robotic, and critical. There’s a lot of emphasis on the brain and barely any attention devoted to the heart. But that isn’t how STEM professionals are in real life! They aren’t heartless automatons. In honor of Valentine’s Day, we’ve gathered a few of our favorite STEM love stories: people who loved each other to the point of invention.
