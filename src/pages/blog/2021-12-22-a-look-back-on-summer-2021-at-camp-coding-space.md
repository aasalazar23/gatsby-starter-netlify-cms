From June to August, we had a blast running a second successful year of Camp Coding Space Online. Campers demonstrated tremendous creativity and commitment as they built projects in Scratch and JavaScript using our online [learning environment](https://coding.space/), and we witnessed some amazing moments, like one of our campers proudly sharing his creation with his younger brother.

We also loved the shout-outs!

In addition to our online camp, we were thrilled to return to our Brooklyn location for one week of in-person camp in July. Campers participated in STEM activities, outdoor fun, and of course, lots of coding! Some of our favorite activities included Feats of Balance, where campers engineered structures out of cups and popsicle sticks to suspend as many blocks as possible over empty space, and Cypher Wheels, where campers created secret codes for encrypting and decrypting messages.

And let’s not forget about the return of [The Coding Space Cup](https://www.thecodingspace.com/the-coding-space-blog/the-coding-space-cup-where-legends-are-made)! Whether online or in person, our campers worked hard to earn points for their teams and cheered each other on regardless of the winner. In the end, whether it was Team Liskov or Team Dijkstra with the trophy, our campers were proud of all that they accomplished — and so were we!

Thanks to all of our kids, families, and counselors who joined us over the summer. We can’t wait to see you next year!
