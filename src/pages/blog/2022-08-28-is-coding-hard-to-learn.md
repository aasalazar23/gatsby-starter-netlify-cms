      ## Because it's NEW


      There’s a grain of truth to this one – in a way, coding is new to pretty much everyone! For people who are adults now, coding wasn’t taught in schools when they were kids. And even for today’s kids, coding still isn’t part of most standard curriculums! Because of this, you might feel like coding is just too unfamiliar to learn – but don’t give up just yet. Even though you might have to seek out a special coding class or camp to learn, you’ll quickly find that the skill of coding builds on lots of skills that you already have: your skill with written language, your computational thinking skills, and your creativity!

      ## Because it TAKES TIME


      This one is also partially true! Mastering the core skills of coding can only be achieved through a journey of obstacles, trial and error, and lots of mini-challenges on the way to expertise. But anything worth learning takes time! Whether you’re learning to play the guitar, learning water polo, or learning to speak Cantonese, picking up a new skill always takes time and persistence. And the time you spend learning coding will have amazing benefits!

      ## Because it USES MATH


      While many people assume that coding requires expertise in math, a lot of coding doesn’t involve math at all! Learning to code involves a lot of Googling, logic, and trial-and-error—but very little beyond simple math. More than anything, if you’re learning to code, you’re going to need to learn how to ask the right questions — something an avid reader can do just as well as an avid mathematician.

There are lots of reasons why people who are curious about coding shy away from learning code – but one of the most common reasons is the belief that coding is just too hard!

\
We’re here to tell you that this is a myth. Learning to code will take time, patience, and discipline, and it will challenge you in all sorts of unexpected ways — but so will any skill worth learning! No one is born understanding code, and people from all backgrounds have learned to code, from 6 year old kids to college math majors to Broadway actors to 65-year olds with no relevant experience!

Here are a few reasons why we think people shy away from learning coding.
