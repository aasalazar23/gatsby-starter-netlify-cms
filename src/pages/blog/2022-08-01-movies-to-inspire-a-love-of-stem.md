      # Alan Turing


      We’ll start with the kingpin — the beloved and widely renowned father of computer science, Alan Turing. In the mid 1930s, Turing devised the idea for a universal machine that could decode and action a set of instructions; this Turing machine, as it came to be known, precedes the digital computers we use today. A graduate of Cambridge and Princeton, Turing worked as a cryptanalyst during World War II, when he designed and created a code-breaking system called the [Bombe](https://www.tnmoc.org/bombe). The Bombe was so adept at deciphering the so-called unbreakable German codes that historians now say Turing effectively shortened the war by as much as [four years](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-18419691). In his work after the war, Turing developed the idea of artificial computer intelligence and devised an experiment to test AI’s ability to think like a human being, which is still referred to today as the “[Turing Test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test).”

      # Christopher Strachey


      After an early career as a physicist and teacher, Christopher Strachey transitioned into computer programming, where he made a name for himself by blending computer science and art. When he was still a total novice, Strachey, over the course of a single evening, wrote one of the first computer music programs, which played “Baa Baa Black Sheep” on the [Ferranti Mark 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferranti_Mark_1). In 1952, by which time he was an accomplished programmer, Strachey developed a love-letter generator that ran on the Manchester Mark 1 using a random number generating algorithm. These projects are widely regarded as the first examples of algorithmic or computational art. Strachey is also remembered as one of the developers of [Combined Programming Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPL_(programming_language)) (CPL), an early precursor to the influential C programming language.

      # Edie Windsor


      Edith Windsor is well-known as the queer rights activist whose victory in the landmark Supreme Court case [United States v. Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor) helped overturn DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act), giving federal recognition to same-sex couples for the first time. Windsor filed the lawsuit after she was unable to claim a tax exemption left to her by her late spouse, as the term “spouse” referred only to heterosexual couples at the time. What’s less well known, however, are Wilson’s contributions as a computer scientist. Windsor worked at IBM for 16 years and achieved the highest technical position at the time, Senior Systems Programmer. Praised especially for her “top-notch debugging skills,” Windsor founded the consulting firm PC Classics after leaving IBM, where she made a point to provide tech educations for queer groups.

      # Jon "Maddog" Hall


      Jon “Maddog” Hall is the board chair for [The Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/) and a vocal champion of free and open-source software. Prior to this, Hall was head of the computer science department at [Hartford State Technical College](https://www.capitalcc.edu/about/), where his temper earned him the nickname “Maddog.” On Alan Turing’s 100th birth anniversary, Hall wrote an [article](https://www.linux-magazine.com/content/view/full/55727) in Linux magazine, in which he came out as gay and called Turing his hero: “\[Turing] did so much for the industry with which I have spent the last 42 years of my life.”

      # Mary Ann Horton


      Mary Ann Horton is a computer scientist and transgender activist. She is one of the principal founders and designers of [Usenet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#:~:text=Usenet%20(%2F%CB%88ju%CB%90z,it%20was%20established%20in%201980.>), a precursor to the modern Internet that is still in use today. Horton also invented uuencode, which was the forerunner to email attachments. In addition to her contributions to technology, Horton has also made significant contributions to transgender rights in the workplace. In 1997, she asked her then employer [Lucent Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent) to include the language “gender identity, characteristics, or expression” in its Equal Opportunity (EO) policy, which led to Lucent becoming the first company in the United States to add transgender-inclusive language to its EO policy.

      # Tim Cook


      In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 organization to come out as gay. The famously private Cook decided to do so after receiving letters from children struggling with their sexual orientation. He came out in a [Bloomberg essay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-speaks-up), saying, “If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is…then it’s worth the trade-off with my privacy.”

Happy Pride Month! We’re stopping in this month to tell you all about the queer history of computing. You probably know a few of the famous LGBTQIA2+ tech pioneers — like Alan Turing and Tim Cook — but we bet you haven’t heard about all 10 of the individuals below whose life work played an integral role in the development of modern computer technology. Many of these individuals lived and worked in an era when social pressures (or even laws) required them to hide their true identities—which makes it all the more fitting that we celebrate them today.
