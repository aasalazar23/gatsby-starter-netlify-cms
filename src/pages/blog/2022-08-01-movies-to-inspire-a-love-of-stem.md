      # Hidden Figures


      *Rating: PG-13*


      This uplifting [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RK8xHq6dfAo) tells the untold story of three [African-American women at NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography) who were instrumental in America's space missions in the 50s and 60s. Not only does this film present a number of scientific principles in an approachable way, it’s also bound to be especially inspiring for girls and children of color. This movie’s three Black protagonists — played by Taraji P. Henderson, Octavia Butler, and Janelle Monae — model academic excellence, confidence, and a passion for STEM, and they show how unity of vision and a commitment to scientific problem-solving can help to overcome all kinds of systemic challenges.

      # The Martian


      *Rating: PG-13*


      Cool science: a contradiction in terms? Not according to thousands of moviegoers who have been mesmerized by [The Martian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ej3ioOneTy8), in which an astronaut (played by Matt Damon) uses his science and math skills to survive being marooned on Mars. To generate water for growing crops, he burns hydrogen in the presence of oxygen. To power up the vehicle he needs to drive to the rescue site, he attaches leftover solar panels and battery packs to his rover. Math helps him determine the battery life he’ll need to reach the rescue site, and computer skills enable him to retool an old Mars lander to communicate with Earth. Your kids will love this space thriller, in which real STEM principles and science fiction collide.

      # Apollo 13


      *Rating: PG*


      Like Hidden Figures, part of [Apollo 13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtEIMC58sZo)’s power to inspire lies in its [basis in real events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_13). Apollo 13, starring Tom Hanks, is a family movie focusing on the lives of the astronauts on board the landmark American expedition to the moon. When numerous technical problems threaten the astronauts’ survival and the success of the mission, the brave protagonists must devise ingenious DIY solutions to land safely back on Earth. This film emphasizes the role of visionary leadership, clear communication, superior teamwork, and unrelenting courage in STEM.

      # Big Hero 6


      *Rating: PG*


      Set in the fictional tech hub of San Fransokyo, [Big Hero 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3biFxZIJOQ) follows the lives of brainy teens who use their ingenious inventions to become self-made superheroes. The 14 year old protagonist Hiro is a tech geek who participates in robotics projects at school and puts his brain to work in positive, practical ways. And though Big Hero 6 focuses on a group of science geeks using chemistry and engineering to battle the forces of evil, it’s also about family, loss, and the power of kindness.

      # Underwater Dreams


      *Rating: Unrated*


      [Underwater Dreams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FqCO5clKR0) is a heartwarming documentary taking American classrooms by storm. It follows the sons of undocumented Mexican immigrants as they learn to build an underwater robot using parts from Home Depot — and take on engineering powerhouse MIT in a national competition. It’s an underdog story, a rousing high school competition film, and an insightful human interest story that shines a light on the underground Americans who deserve recognition.

      # Tim Cook


      In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook became the first CEO of a Fortune 500 organization to come out as gay. The famously private Cook decided to do so after receiving letters from children struggling with their sexual orientation. He came out in a [Bloomberg essay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-speaks-up), saying, “If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone struggling to come to terms with who he or she is…then it’s worth the trade-off with my privacy.”

And that’s great news for parents and educators who want to inspire a love of STEM!

If you’re hoping to use the magic of movies to spark an interest in STEM in your kids, look no further: we’ve assembled a list of kid-friendly films that will nurture your child’s curiosity and show them the power of problem-solving.
