      ### LOLCODE


      [LOLCODE](http://lolcode.org/) was created in 2007 by Adam Lindsay, researcher at Lancaster University. It’s a language comprised entirely of meme-ified “lolspeak”. It may not be the most functional coding language, but what LOLCODE lacks in usefulness, it more than makes up for in hilarity and cuteness. Take a look at the “Hello World!” code!

Have you ever wondered how programming languages come to life? Most functional languages, like the ones we teach at The Coding Space, began as solutions to coding problems. But sometimes, a programming language creator doesn’t want to inhabit such a utilitarian mindset — they want to express their creativity, inject some humor into their work, or show off their niche trivia knowledge.

Welcome to the world of esoteric programming languages, where programmers push the conventions of language design. These languages are not meant to be easy to use. Quite the opposite: they are designed to challenge and amuse coders with their weirdness. 

There is [scientific proof](https://www.inc.com/yoram-solomon/humor-and-sarcasm-can-make-you-creative-science-says.html) that humor boosts creativity and pattern-recognition. In a study that took place at Northwestern University, one group of participants watched a comedy, while the other watched a horror movie. After that, both groups were tasked with solving a word-association puzzle. Can you guess which group was more effective AND more creative?

At TCS, we love these endearingly weird programming languages, not just for their off-kilter humor, but for how they encourage creativity in those who use them. Here are 8 of the most impractical, outlandish, and off-the-wall coding languages ever created.
