      # Eric Yuan


      ### CREATOR OF ZOOM


      In the late 1980s, Eric Yuan was a computer-science student at Shandong University. On numerous 10-hour train rides to visit his girlfriend, Yuan imagined a way to instantly see her face; as a college freshman, he developed his first piece of bespoke video telephony software. Inspired by the American dot-com boom, Yuan dreamed of moving to Silicon Valley, but his dreams were stalled when he was rejected for a visa eight times. When he was finally granted a visa in 1997, he moved to California and was hired as one of the first 20 coders at WebEx, where he became integral to building its video-conferencing platform. Eventually, Yuan began to notice deficiencies in WebEx: connectivity was unstable, audio and video would lag, and the installation process was frustrating. This led Yuan to pitch [Zoom](https://zoom.us/) — a more user-friendly video system. When the higher-ups turned him down, Yuan left to strike out on his own. Zoom was initially intended as a no-frills, highly functional conferencing platform for businesses, but the coronavirus pandemic changed all of that: in March 2020, Zoom was downloaded 2.13 million times in one day. Like Google and Skype, Zoom is now a verb as well as a noun — a symbol of its indispensability in contemporary life.

      # Dr. Josiah Hester


      ### FIRST NATIVE HAWAIIAN TENURE-TRACK COMPUTER SCIENCE PROFESSOR


      Dr. Hester’s lab at Northwestern is called the [Ka Mamoa](http://kamoamoa.eecs.northwestern.edu/) lab. The name comes from Hawaiian voyaging traditions, which date back thousands of years. Hawaiians voyaged across the Pacific in open-air canoes without navigational instruments; the [mamoa](http://kamoamoa.eecs.northwestern.edu/about/) is a small indentation at the rear of the canoe, where the spirit sits to provide guidance on voyages. Dr. Hester chose this name because he considers it the role of scientists to function as a guide for society, especially when tackling global-scale challenges, such as climate change, where often the direction is unknown and the destination far off. In his lab, Dr. Hester and his team are focused on building smart electronic devices to support applications across health care, environmental stewardship, and space exploration: smart face masks that monitor respiration and mask fit, soil-powered sensors for smart cities, and [even a battery-free Game Boy](http://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2020/09/battery-free-game-boy-runs-forever/). 


      For Dr. Hester, coupling computer science with sustainability is deeply motivated by his cultural heritage. As a Native Hawaiian himself, Dr. Hester understands how Native peoples’ expertise about their home landscapes far exceeds the expertise of people with a doctoral education. In his lab, Dr. Hester champions engaging technology to address issues that Indigenous people care deeply about, thereby broadening participation in STEM.
