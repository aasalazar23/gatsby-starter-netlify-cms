We at The Coding Space are continually inspired by the dedicated and caring teachers on our team, especially those who contribute to the wellbeing of the communities they serve. Brenda Castro, a Long Island-based TCS teacher and tutor with Private Prep, is a great example of our culture of caring in action. In addition to helping students learn to think critically, be creative, and code, she volunteers her time as a listener for 7 Cups, an online community for anonymous emotional peer-support. We spoke to her about her experiences doing this unique and important work.

##Thanks so much for being willing to chat with us, Brenda! How did you get involved with 7 Cups?
Thanks for having me! I technically started volunteering with 7 Cups in July of 2015, but I really gave more time starting in March 2020—about 146 hours! I started as a listener and gradually gained more roles. I became an intern and eventually a mentor to other listeners. I now lead discussions and moderate group chats, too.

##Why is volunteering important to you?
I feel fulfilled when I’m interacting with other people and I care deeply about their wellbeing. I’ve been lucky to have the support of so many friends and family, and volunteering allows me to pay some of that kindness forward. Volunteering also lets me focus on doing something that I enjoy and helps others without the added stress of money or performance reviews. I find that getting to be myself sometimes lets me do my best work.

##What have you learned about yourself in doing this work?
Regarding 7 Cups specifically, I have gained further confidence in myself and my decision to become a therapist. I was initially nonplussed by their rule to not give advice. If a member reached out to me with an issue, I instinctively wanted to help them solve it. Instead, by listening, empathizing, and reflecting, I am learning how to support someone without taking any power away from them.

##As a teacher, how do you think students and young people could benefit from volunteering?
Volunteering can help you build a skill, allow you to contribute to a community you care about, give you an opportunity to meet new friends, and feel fulfilled. It can even boost your own mental health because giving can make us happier than receiving. I hope young people definitely consider volunteering!

##How can others become involved with 7 Cups?
Joining the community of 7 Cups is the easiest! You can even give back as a member. Becoming a listener requires a little more training, but it's still easy to sign up. You can do so here.

##Anything else you'd like to add?
Yes, I’d just like to share this quote: "Volunteers don't get paid, not because they're worthless, but because they're priceless." —Sherry Anderson
