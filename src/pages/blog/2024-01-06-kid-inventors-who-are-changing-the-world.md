      ## Gitanjali Rao


      Motivated by the water crisis in Flint, Michigan in 2017, 12-year-old Colorado resident Gitanjali Rao created a compact device to test for lead contamination in water. Her device, called Tethys, uses a disposable cardboard cartridge to mix water samples with a chemical solution, sensors to read the information, and Bluetooth technology to display the result on a mobile app. For her groundbreaking invention, Gitanjali was named America's Top Young Scientist among other honors.


      A﻿nd Gitanjali hasn't stopped there. In 2019 she invented a tool to diagnose prescription opioid addiction at it searly stages, and in 2020, she was crowned Times Kid of the Year. Her project at the time? An app called Kindly that is able to detect cyberbullying based on artificial intelligence technology. She's also an author and dedicated researcher, with plans to delve further into biological engineering and entrepreneurship as a student at MIT.

      ## Kenneth Shinozuka


      At 14, Kenneth Shinozuka wanted to do something to help people like his grandfather who was suffering from night wandering due to Alzheimer's. His solution was the SafeWander® Sock Sensor, a wearable pressure sensor that notifies a caregiver when their patient gets out of bed. Kenneth even developed a mobile app for a comprehensive wireless monitoring system.


      His innovative creation earned him the 2014 Google Science Fair title, the WebMD 2015 Health Hero award, and a feature on NBC News. On May 27, 2014, Kenneth's invention was solidified with the issuance of US Patent 8,736,439.


      Having completed his studies at Harvard, Kenneth is now pursuing his Ph.D. at Oxford, where he's engaged in neuroscience research within the Department of Psychiatry, focusing on Alzheimer’s Disease pathology. He is also the Founder and CEO of SensaRx, a startup based in New York City that has a line of wearable sensor products designed for detecting bed-wandering and preventing falls.

      ## A﻿nna Du


      Anna Du, a young inventor with a passion for the environment, gained recognition when she was just 12 years old. Disturbed by the plastic pollution in our oceans, Anna decided to take action. She developed a remotely operated vehicle (ROV) that uses infrared light to detect microplastics — the tiny particles resulting from the breakdown of larger plastic items — that are severely affecting our oceans. Her invention is designed to help identify and collect data on plastic pollution without the need for costly and time-consuming manual collection.


      Anna's ROV is not only innovative but also showcases her commitment to addressing environmental issues. Her work has been recognized at various science fairs and has earned her accolades, including being a finalist in the Broadcom MASTERS, one of the most prestigious Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) competitions for middle school students.


      Anna authored a book titled "Microplastics and Me" in 2020. The book provides a detailed account of her journey from becoming concerned about environmental issues to developing award-winning solutions. Writing primarily for her peers, Anna aims to raise awareness about microplastic pollution and motivate others, especially the younger generation, to care for the environment.

      ## Ryan Honary


      Since witnessing the destruction of the 2018 Camp Fire in Paradise, California when he was in fifth grade, Ryan Honary has been on a mission to create a technological solution for early wildfire detection. His impressive artificial intelligence-driven system, named "SensoRY AI," has been developed through years of dedication and has earned numerous awards and grants. 


      Now, in collaboration with the Irvine Ranch Conservancy, Ryan is getting the chance to test his sensor network on a larger scale, potentially revolutionizing wildfire prevention. The system, a self-contained wireless network, communicates vital data to predict and alert of fire outbreaks. As Ryan's innovative technology moves from theory to real-world application, it's clear that his efforts could significantly impact environmental conservation and safety, reflecting a bright future for technological solutions to natural world challenges.

      These young individuals are brilliant examples of how age doesn't define
      one's ability to contribute meaningfully to society. Their work not only
      solves real-world problems but also inspires others to think creatively
      and pursue their own ideas for a better future.
