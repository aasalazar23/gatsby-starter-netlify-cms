      In the afternoons, our hub of engineering and STEM excitement—the Lift Off
      Lab—buzzed with activity. Campers eagerly tackled STEM challenges, delving
      into the realms of robotics and engineering. They constructed alarm
      devices, designed autonomous vehicles, and prototyped Mars hovercrafts. On
      top of these challenges, we added a dash of outdoor adventure, ensuring a
      well-rounded and exhilarating camp experience. 


      But we didn't stop at the camp. Field trips to Google, Etsy, Hungryroot, and Samsung gave campers a taste of the real tech world. And for the high schoolers, we introduced The Coding Space Academy, a thrilling two-week program that concluded with a spectacular capstone project showcase.


      Big thanks to all the kids, families, and counselors who made this summer memorable. We're already looking forward to next year for more coding fun!
