      Lift Off Lab—buzzed with activity. Campers eagerly tackled STEM
      challenges, delving into the realms of robotics and engineering. They
      constructed alarm devices, designed autonomous vehicles, and prototyped
      Mars hovercrafts.

      But we didn't stop at the camp. Field trips to Google, Etsy, Hungryroot,
      and Samsung gave campers a taste of the real tech world. And for the high
      schoolers, we introduced The Coding Space Academy, a thrilling two-week
      program that concluded with a spectacular capstone project showcase.


      Big thanks to all the kids, families, and counselors who made this summer memorable. We're already looking forward to next year for more coding fun!
