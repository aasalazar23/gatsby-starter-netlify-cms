Anyone who has ever watched a toddler methodically take apart a Tupperware drawer should know that many children are natural-born engineers. As parents, teachers, and caretakers, we get to nurture their creativity — and clean up the mess afterward. Wrap up a few of these STEM toys for your future scientist to craft, tinker with, dismantle, or program. Hopefully, they'll thank you for the early encouragement when they're older.
