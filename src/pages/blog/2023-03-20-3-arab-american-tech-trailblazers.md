      ## Rana el Kaliouby


      *Founder of Affectiva & Emotional Recognition Tech Pioneer*


      [Rana el Kaliouby](https://ranaelkaliouby.com/) is an Egyptian-American computer scientist, AI thought leader, angel investor, and entrepreneur working to humanize technology. While she was completing her doctoral research at the University of Cambridge, she struggled to connect with her loved ones in video calls back home. So, after earning her doctorate, el Kaliouby joined the Affective Computing group at MIT, where she helped develop an “emotional hearing aid” and a pair of glasses that could read emotions and social cues. These tools comprised the Emotional-Social Intelligence Prosthesis, wearable tech for people with autism who have trouble identifying other people’s emotions. In 2009, el Kaliouby co-founded Affectiva, a company that develops pioneering emotional recognition technology. She is also an executive fellow at the Harvard Business School and author of Girl Decoded: A Scientist’s Quest to Reclaim Our Humanity by Bringing Emotional Intelligence to Technology.

      ## Tony Fadell


      *Father of the iPod*


      When Apple was on the verge of collapse in 2001, they called Arab American inventor [Tony Fadell](https://www.buildc.com/meet-tony). Apple CEO Steve Jobs had imagined a product that could save his company — a personal music player that could put 1000 songs in your pocket. But there was no design, no team, no prototype, and no real traction for the idea. Undeterred, Fadell assembled a team and got to work. The result was the iPod, which launched in November 2001 and revolutionized the entire industry. Fadell oversaw the first 18 iterations of the iPod before Jobs gave him his next assignment: to create a new version of the iPod that also had the capabilities of a mobile phone. You guessed it — the result was the first iPhone, the invention of which was spearheaded by Fadell. After leaving Apple, Fadell has continued inventing and building game-changing personal tech, like the Nest thermostat.

      ## Taher Elgamal


      *The Architect of Internet Security*


      The topic of online privacy and security is dominating the airwaves now, but that wasn’t always the case. However, thanks to early tech visionaries like Egyptian-American Taher Elgamal, developments in internet security and cryptography are rapidly advancing. Elgamal began his pioneering work in the 1980s, before truly anyone else was considering security algorithms. His paper “[A Public Key Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme based on Discrete Logarithms](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-39568-7_2),” published in 1984, formed the bases of the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) and the Advanced Encryption Standard. Additionally, Elgamal was the driving force behind the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), a protocol that keeps online communications (like email!) secure.

      ## Muriel Tramis


      **Company:** Coktel Vision


      **Games:** Freedom, Gobliiins, Lost in Time, Mewilo


      After working as an engineer for an aerospace company, Muriel Tramis returned to her first love: games. She found a job at a video game start-up and began designing rich puzzle-adventure games that became wildly commercially successful. Unlike other popular video games of the time (think Super Mario Bros), Tramis’s games push back against the idea that video games, as a medium, can only encompass light, silly fare for kids. Her games grapple with powerful historical questions — for example, Freedom is about enslaved people fighting against their masters. Now considered a visionary, Tramis’s work recognized the potential of gaming to incorporate the kinds of themes that were, at the time, reserved for more “serious” mediums like film and literature. If it weren’t for Tramis busting open the genre, we might not have recent gaming sensations like Last of Us!

      ## Danielle Bunten Berry


      **Company:** Atari


      **Games:** M.U.L.E.


      Bunten Berry was a pioneer game developer who created one of the first successful multiplayer games on the Atari platform. Decades before blockbuster multiplayer games like League of Legends came to dominate gaming, Bunten Berry designed the groundbreaking multiplayer game [M.U.L.E](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.U.L.E.). M.U.L.E. sold 30,000 copies across various computer platforms and, over the years, it has emerged as one of the greatest influences on the genre's greatest designers. Ahead of her time in more ways than one, Bunten Berry insisted that the future of gaming was interconnectedness, and her vision has proved incredibly prescient. In 1998, she was awarded the [Lifetime Achievement Award](https://www.gamechoiceawards.com/archive/lifetime) by the Computer Game Developers Association. In 2007, the Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences chose Berry as the 10th inductee into its [Hall of Fame](https://www.interactive.org/special_awards/).

      ## **Roberta Williams**


      **Company:** Sierra


      **Games:** Mystery House, King’s Quest series, Phantasmagoria, Space Quest, and more!


      In 1980, Roberta Williams, a soft-spoken housewife with little coding or design experience created Mystery House, the first-ever computer game with graphics. While she couldn’t have known it then, Williams’ kitchen-table hobby would found the graphic adventure genre and become the origin of graphic design in computing and tech. Before Williams, adventure games were walls of text—innovating in leaps and bounds, she added graphics, music, and even voice actors to her games, completely disrupting the gaming industry. Williams and her husband, a programmer at IBM, formed the company [Sierra](https://www.sierragames.com/) and became the dominating force in computer games. By the time Williams retired in 1996, she was credited with more than 30 top computer games. For their massive influence on the video game industry, she and her husband received the Industry Icon Award in 2014.

      ## **Risa Tabata & Aya Kyogoku**


      **Company:** Nintendo


      **Games:** Paper Mario, Donkey Kong, The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, Super Smash Bros Ultimate, and more!


      Both of these women are fully deserving of their own entries in this list, but they have been such frequent collaborators that it seemed right to keep the dream team together! Tabata and Kyokguku are video game producers and directors at Nintendo, and their fingerprints are all over many of the games that dominate the contemporary gaming landscape: The Legend of Zelda, Animal Crossing, Super Smash Bros Ultimate…the list goes on! We can’t wait to see all of the games that these two dream up in the decades to come.
