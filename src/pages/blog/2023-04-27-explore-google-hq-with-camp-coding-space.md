      Every summer The Coding Space offers unique opportunities to visit tech
      spaces to experience new technology, meet experts in the field, view
      unique workspaces, and gain exposure to what it’s like to work in the
      industry. We’re thrilled to offer a trip to Google as part of our amazing
      line-up of activities. In addition to field trips, our camp days include
      project-based coding, outdoor fun, and a whole host of STEM activities
      through our Lift-Off Lab where campers will have the opportunity to
      explore robotics, circuitry, animation, 3D modeling, and
      more. [](https://www.thecodingspace.com/programs/summer-camps/)
