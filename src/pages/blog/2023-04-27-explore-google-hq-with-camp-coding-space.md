      # Field Trips


      The Coding Space is thrilled to announce our field trips to **Google, Etsy, and Samsung** this summer! Check out our field trip schedule breakdown below, and keep an eye out for updates — we're expecting to add more field trip destinations in the next few weeks.


      **Google**


      Campers who sign up for camp during the week of June 26th or the week of August 7th will visit Google's NYC headquarters! The field trip will include:


      * A tour of [Google’s new campus](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/21/google-opens-hudson-river-campus-to-attract-more-new-york-talent.html) 

      * Q&A with a panel of Google engineers

      * Lunch at Google


      **Etsy**


      Camp Coding Space will be heading off to Etsy's famous Brooklyn headquarters during the week of July 10th, where they'll dive into the tech side of e-commerce and hear from the nation’s top computer scientists blending artistry and tech.


      Check out [this video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cg_5gCDgZis/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) from our visit to Etsy last year, where we toured their sustainable living building, spoke with nine Etsy engineers, and spent time tinkering in their makerspace.


      **Samsung**


      Young coders who sign up for camp during the week of July 24th will get to experience the digital dreamscape that is Samsung 837, an experiential tech wonderland in the Meatpacking District featuring a living lab, a VR tunnel, digital art installations, and three floors of dynamic, immersive programming powered by state-of-the-art technology.


      Check out our [blog](https://www.thecodingspace.com/blog/2022-07-27-the-coding-space-samsung-837/) about our visit to Samsung 837 last year, plus the [recap video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CghcY_wgjkz/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) from our day in the Samsung Metaverse!

      Every summer The Coding Space offers unique opportunities to visit tech
      spaces to experience new technology, meet experts in the field, view
      unique workspaces, and gain exposure to what it’s like to work in the
      industry. We’re thrilled to offer a trip to Google as part of our amazing
      line-up of activities. In addition to field trips, our camp days include
      project-based coding, outdoor fun, and a whole host of STEM activities
      through our Lift-Off Lab where campers will have the opportunity to
      explore robotics, circuitry, animation, 3D modeling, and
      more. [](https://www.thecodingspace.com/programs/summer-camps/)
