## 1. Web developer

Web developers create and maintain websites. They might work in a wide variety of industries spanning tech, publishing, management consulting, advertising, or be self employed. Back-end web developers create the website’s structure, write code, and verify the code works, while front-end web developers work on the visual part of the website, designing the layout of each page, integrating graphics, and use HTML and JavaScript to enhance the site. Full-stack web developers do it all!



## 2. Tech Writer

A technical writer is a professional writer who can communicate complex information in a clear, concise, readable way for a broad audience. Not all inventors or engineers or doctors are good communicators – so after they’ve developed their product, they need someone else to explain that product’s benefits to the general public, translating technical jargon into accessible language. Software engineers and cryptocurrency experts frequently need help writing user interface text, software release notes, and more. For technical writers to stay competitive in an increasingly code-able world, they should have basic familiarity with the primary coding languages.

## 3. Software Developer

Software developers use programming and design knowledge to—well—build software! Typically, they meet with a client with a need for a specific piece of software, and then they build, test and deploy that software based on the client’s specifications. Because software is involved across virtually every industry to power that field’s devices and applications, you can find software developers working in business, technology, defense, healthcare, aerospace, manufacturing, and more.

## 4. Entrepreneurship

Technology has ushered in the century of the entrepreneur. Thanks to the power of the Internet, founders and CEOs can reach a global audience in minutes. But anyone starting a business in a tech-driven economy like ours will need to understand the code that drives their business. Entrepreneurs who know how to code will make for far better supervisors, because they’ll have a clearer grasp of how their business’s programming method runs, why specific computer languages are preferred, and which languages will users to implement their concepts. Familiarity with the major coding languages such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, Python, and Ruby will empower entrepreneurs to make decisions that will improve their business. 

## 5. Cybersecurity Engineers

Cybersecurity engineers protect devices, services, and networks from malicious digital attacks. They also regularly test security systems to ensure they’re functioning properly. Cybersecurity engineers are the first line of defense against data breaches, safeguarding organizational data, sensitive and confidential information, financial information, and the reputation of their organization as a whole. In addition to soft skills like communication, problem-solving, and speed of learning, proficiency in cyber programming languages like C/C++, Java, Python, Go, and Ruby, is a huge advantage for potential cybersecurity professionals.

## 6. Mobile App Developer

Smartphones and tablets are increasingly becoming the computer of choice for more and more people. Mobile app developers write the code that power the applications and software for smartphones and other mobile devices. Instead of building for a larger PC screen, these developers are dealing with extremely small screens, typically writing programs using either C, C++, Python, or Java. 

## 7. Entertainment

Coding is in the arts and entertainment industry too! Artists and entertainers may not think of coding as a skill that they need to launch successful careers, but a foundation in code is a boon to all. For example, visual artists and illustrators can use a degree in coding to propel themselves into the world of animation. Not only do these artists need to have visual creativity and inspiration, they also need the technical skills to make that inspiration visible using animation software. Gamers, on the other hand, can launch exciting careers as game developers with some coding knowledge. In order to both imagine entire playable worlds and translate those worlds into language that a computer can understand, game developers need a range of exciting skills: coding proficiency, physics knowledge (how fast should the player’s avatar drop when they jump off a castle wall?!), excellent communication and collaboration skills, and familiarity with gaming engines like Unity or Unreal.
