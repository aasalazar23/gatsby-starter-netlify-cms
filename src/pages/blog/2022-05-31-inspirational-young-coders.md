      ## Muhammad Hamza Shahzad


      In 2016, Muhammad Hamza Shahzad, a British-Pakistani boy growing up in Birmingham, UK became the youngest qualified computer programmer in the world at the age of seven. When he was only 6 years old, he took the famously difficult Microsoft exam and passed with flying colors, earning him a highly sought-after certification from Microsoft. Technically, with this certificate, Muhammad could leave elementary school now and land a high-paying job in IT! Muhammad, who received his first computer at the age of 2 and a half, has been largely tutored by his father, who is a tech-whiz at the American IT company Cyber Royal. These days, Muhammad is working on developing a game that can be won in less than 30 clicks.

      ## Arham Om Talsania


      Four years after Muhammad Hamza Shahzad set the record, Arham Om Talsania broke it, becoming the current Guinness World Record holder for the youngest computer programmer in the world. Arham cracked the Python programming language exam, an exam considered difficult even by aspiring adult engineers, in January of 2020. He is currently busily producing 2D, 3D, and text-based versions of his own video game and aspires to design robots that can help people in need.

      # Edie Windsor


      Edith Windsor is well-known as the queer rights activist whose victory in the landmark Supreme Court case [United States v. Windsor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Windsor) helped overturn DOMA (Defense of Marriage Act), giving federal recognition to same-sex couples for the first time. Windsor filed the lawsuit after she was unable to claim a tax exemption left to her by her late spouse, as the term “spouse” referred only to heterosexual couples at the time. What’s less well known, however, are Wilson’s contributions as a computer scientist. Windsor worked at IBM for 16 years and achieved the highest technical position at the time, Senior Systems Programmer. Praised especially for her “top-notch debugging skills,” Windsor founded the consulting firm PC Classics after leaving IBM, where she made a point to provide tech educations for queer groups.

      # Jon "Maddog" Hall


      Jon “Maddog” Hall is the board chair for [The Linux Professional Institute](https://www.lpi.org/) and a vocal champion of free and open-source software. Prior to this, Hall was head of the computer science department at [Hartford State Technical College](https://www.capitalcc.edu/about/), where his temper earned him the nickname “Maddog.” On Alan Turing’s 100th birth anniversary, Hall wrote an [article](https://www.linux-magazine.com/content/view/full/55727) in Linux magazine, in which he came out as gay and called Turing his hero: “\[Turing] did so much for the industry with which I have spent the last 42 years of my life.”

      # Mary Ann Horton


      Mary Ann Horton is a computer scientist and transgender activist. She is one of the principal founders and designers of [Usenet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#:~:text=Usenet%20(%2F%CB%88ju%CB%90z,it%20was%20established%20in%201980.>), a precursor to the modern Internet that is still in use today. Horton also invented uuencode, which was the forerunner to email attachments. In addition to her contributions to technology, Horton has also made significant contributions to transgender rights in the workplace. In 1997, she asked her then employer [Lucent Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent) to include the language “gender identity, characteristics, or expression” in its Equal Opportunity (EO) policy, which led to Lucent becoming the first company in the United States to add transgender-inclusive language to its EO policy.

    mdContent: In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook became the first CEO of a Fortune 500
      organization to come out as gay. The famously private Cook decided to do
      so after receiving letters from children struggling with their sexual
      orientation. He came out in a [Bloomberg
      essay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-speaks-up),
      saying, “If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone
      struggling to come to terms with who he or she is…then it’s worth the
      trade-off with my privacy.”
