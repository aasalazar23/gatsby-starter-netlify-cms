      ## Muhammad Hamza Shahzad


      In 2016, Muhammad Hamza Shahzad, a British-Pakistani boy growing up in Birmingham, UK became the youngest qualified computer programmer in the world at the age of seven. When he was only 6 years old, he took the famously difficult Microsoft exam and passed with flying colors, earning him a highly sought-after certification from Microsoft. Technically, with this certificate, Muhammad could leave elementary school now and land a high-paying job in IT! Muhammad, who received his first computer at the age of 2 and a half, has been largely tutored by his father, who is a tech-whiz at the American IT company Cyber Royal. These days, Muhammad is working on developing a game that can be won in less than 30 clicks.

      ## Arham Om Talsania


      Four years after Muhammad Hamza Shahzad set the record, Arham Om Talsania broke it, becoming the current Guinness World Record holder for the youngest computer programmer in the world. Arham cracked the Python programming language exam, an exam considered difficult even by aspiring adult engineers, in January of 2020. He is currently busily producing 2D, 3D, and text-based versions of his own video game and aspires to design robots that can help people in need.

      ## Tanmay Bakshi


      Canadian coder Tanmay is not only a software developer, but a [TEDx speaker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-lyzsqnK-c), YouTuber, author, and the world’s youngest IBM Watson developer. Tanmay began to learn programming at the age of 5; by age eight, he had designed his first app, and by age nine, he had built a now-popular iPhone app called “tTables” that helps kids learn multiplication tables. At age 12, Tanmay became the youngest IBM Watson developer in the world. Tanmay also devotes himself to spreading knowledge by authoring multiple books — including [Hello Swift!](https://www.manning.com/books/hello-swift), an iOS programming guide for kids — and by uploading videos to his YouTube channel [Tanmay Teaches](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8f_QLkpIEg). In his free time, Tanmay is working on a project with IBM to help a quadriplegic woman learn how to communicate through the power of artificial intelligence.

      ## Isabel Sieh


      Filipino-American teenager Isabel Sieh learned how to code through Code Academy at the age of ten. When Isabel moved from New York to the Philippines, her individual passion for coding blossomed into community-centered education & activism; she founded [Girls Will Code](https://www.girlswillcode.com/), an organization that encourages girls to participate in activities related to coding, programming, robotics and engineering. Through her effort, Isabel is working to ensure that kids — and young girls especially — have the opportunity to learn the basics of coding, jump-starting their coding journeys.

      # Mary Ann Horton


      Mary Ann Horton is a computer scientist and transgender activist. She is one of the principal founders and designers of [Usenet](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet#:~:text=Usenet%20(%2F%CB%88ju%CB%90z,it%20was%20established%20in%201980.>), a precursor to the modern Internet that is still in use today. Horton also invented uuencode, which was the forerunner to email attachments. In addition to her contributions to technology, Horton has also made significant contributions to transgender rights in the workplace. In 1997, she asked her then employer [Lucent Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucent) to include the language “gender identity, characteristics, or expression” in its Equal Opportunity (EO) policy, which led to Lucent becoming the first company in the United States to add transgender-inclusive language to its EO policy.

Born in Taiwan, Audrey Tang is a self-taught programmer who was learning Perl at the age of 12, launching a startup at 15, and working in Silicon Valley by 19. A programming wunderkind, Tang is well-known for leading the [Pugs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pugs_(programming)) project to develop the Perl 6 language, starting the [Perl Archive Toolkit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perl_Archive_Toolkit) (PAT), and their role as an outspoken advocate for free software and an open web.

    mdContent: In 2014, Apple CEO Tim Cook became the first CEO of a Fortune 500
      organization to come out as gay. The famously private Cook decided to do
      so after receiving letters from children struggling with their sexual
      orientation. He came out in a [Bloomberg
      essay](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-30/tim-cook-speaks-up),
      saying, “If hearing that the CEO of Apple is gay can help someone
      struggling to come to terms with who he or she is…then it’s worth the
      trade-off with my privacy.”
