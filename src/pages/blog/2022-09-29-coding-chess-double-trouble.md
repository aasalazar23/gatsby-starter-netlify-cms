Pop quiz: what activity builds critical thinking skills, intellectual confidence, and independence? If you answered **CODING**, you're correct! If you answered **CHESS**, you're also correct!

 We’ve joined forces with [Chess at Three](https://chessat3.com/), an organization that teaches chess strategy through storytelling, to inspire a love of logic & creativity in kids from all over NYC. In September, we traveled just blocks away to their location on 5th Avenue and taught introductory coding to their young chess wizards. We're looking forward to next month, when the good folks at Chess at 3 will come teach chess to our young coders at our Park Slope location!

Scroll down for photos of this exciting crossover event. And give your child a head-start this fall by signing up for coding or chess in Park Slope and the Upper East Side!
