description: Welcome to the Spring Semester! We’re so excited to offer the
  second semester of in person classes since the pandemic began, as well as
  continue our successful online program. We’ve had a magical fall as we
  welcomed back familiar faces and met new ones, too. We’ve been reminded many
  times these past few months about the inherent joy coding brings to us all,
  and we can’t wait to bring that into the new year.

This spring we’re looking forward to opening a new space on the Upper East Side (details coming soon!), as well as continuing our programs in Brooklyn, Long Island, Westchester, and Online. Here’s a taste of what else is happening here at The Coding Space:

* We’re partnering with new schools to bring our coding program to them (interested in bringing our program to your school? [Learn more here](https://www.thecodingspace.com/for-schools.html))
* We’re gearing up to run our annual Code 4 Change Challenge in March
* We’ve recently welcomed two amazing new team members ([meet Melissa and Aspen!](https://thecodingspace.com/team))
* We’re launching new partnerships to deepen our impact in our communities (we’re thrilled to be sponsored by [TradeZero](https://www.tradezero.co/) to provide free classes to over 50 kids through [East Flatbush Village](https://eastflatbushvillage.org/) this year)

We’re so excited for the year ahead and to share a large part of it with you, our families. Have a great rest of 2021 and we’ll see you soon!\
