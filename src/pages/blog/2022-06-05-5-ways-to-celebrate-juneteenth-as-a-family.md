      ## Cook traditional food


      Nothing says celebration like a special meal! Break out the grill for some old fashioned barbecue — or, try one of these traditional [Juneteenth recipes](https://cooking.nytimes.com/68861692-nyt-cooking/24232457-juneteenth-recipes-curated-by-nicole-taylor?ds_c=71700000052595478&gclid=CjwKCAjwjtOTBhAvEiwASG4bCF06fj2ordDzs3pZhFhKCN--U_p5aXUGot3rr6bnrQp16zFeLUBK8BoCd-QQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds). Because the color red symbolizes the resilience of the enslaved, most Juneteenth feasts feature red foods like pork, heirloom tomatoes, or strawberries. If cooking isn’t your truth, order from a [Black-owned restaurant](https://www.thrillist.com/eat/new-york/black-owned-restaurants-in-nyc-you-need-to-know) instead.

Juneteenth (also known as Freedom Day, Jubilee Day, or Emancipation Day) is a day to honor and celebrate liberation. It’s a celebration of the day in 1865 when word of the Emancipation Proclamation — which had been signed two years prior and freed all enslaved people — made its way to Texas.

Why the delay? Back then, Texas was extremely remote; it took a long time for news of General Lee’s surrender at Appomattox to make its way to Texas. And even after word had finally reached Texas, many enslavers tried to hide the news or otherwise delay emancipation. On June 19, 1865, Union troops made it to Galveston Bay, TX and announced that all enslaved Black people in the state were freed by federal decree.

Juneteenth is sometimes called America’s true independence day, on the grounds that July 4, 1776, only represents the day that white male Americans became free. On June 17, 2021, after a decades-long push by American activists and leaders, President Biden signed the Juneteenth National Independence Day Act, officially marking June 19 as a federal holiday! Keep reading for five fun ways to celebrate Juneteenth with the whole family.
