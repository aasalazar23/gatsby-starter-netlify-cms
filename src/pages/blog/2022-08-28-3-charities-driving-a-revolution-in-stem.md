      ## Motherboard


      Think of the [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard) like the computer’s base camp. It’s a thin plate that directly or indirectly **connects every single part of the computer** – the CPU, memory, hard drive, USB ports, etc.

      ## CPU


      The [CPU](https://www.arm.com/glossary/cpu) (or central processing unit, or even just “processor”) is like **the brain of the computer**. It’s usually a two-inch ceramic square with a silicon chip the size of a thumbnail located inside, and its primary job is to carry out commands. Whenever you click a button or press a key, you’re sending an instruction to the CPU.

      ## RAM


      [RAM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory) (or random access memory) is your computer’s **short-term memory**. Whenever your computer performs any type of calculation, it temporarily stores that data in RAM. RAM helps programs boot quickly, but it doesn’t last – anytime your computer powers down, it loses everything stored in RAM. That’s why you need to save your documents; anytime you hit that “save” button on a Word doc, you’re moving that information to long-term storage.

      ## Long-term Storage


      Every computer needs somewhere to store its data: your software, your documents, and all of your other files. That storage can take the form of a [hard drive or a solid state drive](https://www.avast.com/c-ssd-vs-hdd), and it’s long-term, meaning that **the data is safe even if you turn off the computer.** When you open a file, the computer copies some data from the hard drive onto the RAM, and when you save a file, the data is copied back to the hard drive.
