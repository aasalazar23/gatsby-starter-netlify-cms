      ## AbleGamers


      Dedicated to “combating isolation through play”, [AbleGamers](https://ablegamers.org/) is a nonprofit fighting to improve accessibility in video games. For people with disabilities, who are at a [heightened risk](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7403030/) of social isolation, video games can be the perfect gateway to community participation, lifelong friendships, and positive shared experiences. That’s why AbleGamers continues to push inclusivity forward in the video game industry by training and consulting with studios as well as connecting those studios directly with disabled players who can share their experiences.

    mdContent: A humanitarian approach to STEM has allowed us to solve global
      problems, find cures to diseases, and invent machines that improve
      people's lives. At The Coding Space, we will continue to do our part to
      train the next generation of STEM professionals, not only by teaching them
      technical skills, but by encouraging them to envision coding as a tool for
      positive change.
