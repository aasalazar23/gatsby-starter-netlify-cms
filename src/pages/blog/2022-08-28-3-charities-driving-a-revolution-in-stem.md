      ## Revolution Robotics


      [Revolution Robotics](https://revolutionrobotics.org/) is a non-profit focused on making kids robotics programs affordable, accessible, fair, and fun. They create robotics kits and challenges that develop critical 21st century work skills, while inspiring kids around the world to pursue degrees and careers in STEM. This nonprofit envisions a future in which high school robotics competitions are as popular as Friday night football!

      ## CPU


      The [CPU](https://www.arm.com/glossary/cpu) (or central processing unit, or even just “processor”) is like **the brain of the computer**. It’s usually a two-inch ceramic square with a silicon chip the size of a thumbnail located inside, and its primary job is to carry out commands. Whenever you click a button or press a key, you’re sending an instruction to the CPU.

      ## RAM


      [RAM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory) (or random access memory) is your computer’s **short-term memory**. Whenever your computer performs any type of calculation, it temporarily stores that data in RAM. RAM helps programs boot quickly, but it doesn’t last – anytime your computer powers down, it loses everything stored in RAM. That’s why you need to save your documents; anytime you hit that “save” button on a Word doc, you’re moving that information to long-term storage.

      ## Long-term Storage


      Every computer needs somewhere to store its data: your software, your documents, and all of your other files. That storage can take the form of a [hard drive or a solid state drive](https://www.avast.com/c-ssd-vs-hdd), and it’s long-term, meaning that **the data is safe even if you turn off the computer.** When you open a file, the computer copies some data from the hard drive onto the RAM, and when you save a file, the data is copied back to the hard drive.
