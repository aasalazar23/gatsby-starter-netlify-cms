      Code 4 Change projects will be visible on our website starting Wednesday, May 24th where everyone will have the chance to vote for Coders’ Choice - the project that coders think deserves to be highlighted for showcasing particularly impressive coding skills, sustainable solutions, and educational value. Our team of Mentors will also be awarding winners in several categories.


      **Oh, and did we mention there are prizes?**


      Each category winner will receive a donation of $50 to support an organization that embodies the spirit of Code 4 Change, as well as a certificate of achievement. All projects will be featured on the TCS website, and winning projects will be showcased in a special blog.


      We’ll be revealing the winners on Friday, June 2nd at 6:45pm. Tune in on Instagram to watch the livestream or see it in person at our Upper East Side location. Doors open at 6!
