      ## Motherboard


      Think of the [motherboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motherboard) like the computer’s base camp. It’s a thin plate that directly or indirectly **connects every single part of the computer** – the CPU, memory, hard drive, USB ports, etc.

      ## CPU


      The [CPU](https://www.arm.com/glossary/cpu) (or central processing unit, or even just “processor”) is like **the brain of the computer**. It’s usually a two-inch ceramic square with a silicon chip the size of a thumbnail located inside, and its primary job is to carry out commands. Whenever you click a button or press a key, you’re sending an instruction to the CPU.

      ## RAM


      [RAM](https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/RAM-random-access-memory) (or random access memory) is your computer’s **short-term memory**. Whenever your computer performs any type of calculation, it temporarily stores that data in RAM. RAM helps programs boot quickly, but it doesn’t last – anytime your computer powers down, it loses everything stored in RAM. That’s why you need to save your documents; anytime you hit that “save” button on a Word doc, you’re moving that information to long-term storage.

      ## Ghost Rockets


      *Ages: 14-17*


      Use a spin on the old mentos-and-Diet-Coke trick to make [flying ghost rockets](https://www.growingajeweledrose.com/2013/09/ghost-rockets-halloween-activity.html)! You can even run several “trials” of this experiment, varying the ingredients to see how the flight patterns are affected.

If you’re not that enamored by technical jargon (and let’s be honest: who is?), you probably refer to all of the discrete parts that comprise the glowing machine on your desk as simply “the computer”. Each magical, buzzing, clicking, whooshing tecno-innard gets grouped indiscriminately under that umbrella term. And for the most part, that’s totally great! But sometimes – when something in your computer isn’t working as it should, for example – it can help to get a little bit more specific about what’s going on under the hood. Below, we’ve broken down the basic components of a computer, including each one’s location and function.
