      “Inside this building in New York City, the future of the Metaverse is
      hard at work,” Vlad says in his introduction to The Coding Space on Nick
      News. As we watched the interview play on national TV, we realized that
      couldn’t be more true. When students come through our doors and open up
      their computers, we are humbled by the magnitude of what we are teaching
      them and the exponential opportunities to which it will lead. A student
      learning to code today in Scratch, MIT’s block-based programming language
      we use in our beginner classes, is developing the same thought process
      they will use to code 3D avatars in the metaverse tomorrow and will be
      lightyears ahead of those without that exposure. 


      As students learn to make games, animations, and apps, they are developing mental models that help them understand the world around them. How do I take an idea and turn it into something tangible? How is gravity involved in making my character jump? How could I use code to make a machine work? The Socratic-based teaching methods at the root of our educational philosophy challenge them to think through processes and discover solutions on their own as we ask them thought-provoking questions. We teach our kids not to be passive consumers of rapidly advancing technology but instead makers and co-creators of our future world. 


      During the interview, Vlad asks one of our awesome students Sadie what it feels like when she’s coded something and sees the result of it. Her reply? “I feel so surprised at myself.” Not only are we supplying students with the skills they need to be tomorrow’s engineers, scientists, and CEOs, we are giving them the confidence to embark on the journey in the first place. With each problem solved, new creation, lightning bolt idea, they ask themselves, “What can I do next?” And away they go.

In March, Nickelodeon stopped by with CBS anchor Vlad Duthiers to film a segment on the power of learning code for kids living in the Metaverse. We were over the moon at the chance to tell America all about how an unconventional coding education can help kids develop intellectual confidence, a growth mindset, self-expression, and computational thinking skills.
