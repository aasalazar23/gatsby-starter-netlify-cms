      ## 1. Find them a mentor


      A good mentor can push a teenager in ways that parents sometimes can’t, providing a much-needed source of positive leadership and guidance at a time when teenagers are staking out their independence. In addition to helping teenagers build confidence and discipline, a rockstar STEM mentor can also spark a high schooler’s curiosity about STEM fields, shatter stereotypes about who practices STEM, and demonstrate the diversity of STEM career options. Does your teen admire an upperclassman who’s planning on majoring in Bio in college? Do they love their Physics teacher? Do they have a cool cousin working at a programming start-up? Any of these figures could make for an awesome mentor.

      ## 2. Learn on the job


      STEM internships can give high schoolers a chance to learn the ins & outs of a STEM career first-hand. Check out some local tech companies & STEM start-ups to see if they have high school internship programs. Who knows? Maybe your teenager will write an amazing college essay about how they discovered their love of coding during their summer at Verizon!

      ## Intermediate Code


      Also open to ages 8-14, Intermediate Code is designed for students who are coding complex projects in Scratch and soon ready to move on to [WoofJS](https://woofjs.com), our JavaScript learning platform. WoofJS was built by The Coding Space to help students transition from block-based programming to text-based languages, where they’ll learn syntax, functions, and how to read documentation. When students are ready for our Advanced class, they’ll have coded a project of a similar complexity to [Flappy Bird Game](https://woofjs.com/create.html#flappy-bird-example-1).

      ## Advanced Code


      In our Advanced class, students ages 8-14 code increasingly complex projects in WoofJS, and when they’re ready, start programming in a web-based environment. They’ll learn HTML & CSS and build their JavaScript skills to make projects that can run in any web browser. Maybe they’ll build a [to-do list](https://coding.space/v1/web/code/my-to-do-list-code.html) or [make a quiz](https://coding.space/v1/web/code/make-a-quiz-code.html)! As students get more familiar with JavaScript, they’ll switch into self-directed learning mode where they can try out other languages including Python to see what engages them most.

Children are natural scientists – full of curiosity and wonder about the world around them. But often in the teenage years, this natural interest can diminish as teenagers begin to think of science as boring, confusing or difficult. Don’t panic: we promise that your kid’s thirst for learning is intact. They probably just feel bored or unchallenged by their school STEM classes! Here are five ways to help rekindle a love of STEM in your teenager.
