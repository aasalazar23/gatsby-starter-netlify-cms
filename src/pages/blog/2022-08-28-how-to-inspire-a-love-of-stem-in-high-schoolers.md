      ## Young Beginner Code


      Young Beginner Code is built specifically for ages 6-8. If your young coder has no coding experience, we’ll likely start them out in code.org, a platform that introduces them to key concepts such as sequence, events, and loops; or ScratchJr, a precursor to Scratch, MIT’s introductory language designed for children. If your child has experience in Scratch already, we’ll likely start them there. Young Beginner classes are 90 minutes and include an offline activity to allow students to take a step back from the screen and reinforce concepts in a different way.

      ## Beginner Code


      Beginner Code welcomes all students between ages 8-14. While no experience is required, it’s likely that some students will come into class already having coded in Scratch, or another language. Our self-paced, project-based curriculum is designed specifically for mixed level classrooms; we’ll assess where students are in their coding journey on day one and find just the right spot for them to be challenged and engaged. Beginner students are ready for our Intermediate class when they’ve coded a project similar in complexity to this [Typing Game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/369713744/editor/).

      ## Intermediate Code


      Also open to ages 8-14, Intermediate Code is designed for students who are coding complex projects in Scratch and soon ready to move on to [WoofJS](https://woofjs.com), our JavaScript learning platform. WoofJS was built by The Coding Space to help students transition from block-based programming to text-based languages, where they’ll learn syntax, functions, and how to read documentation. When students are ready for our Advanced class, they’ll have coded a project of a similar complexity to [Flappy Bird Game](https://woofjs.com/create.html#flappy-bird-example-1).

      ## Advanced Code


      In our Advanced class, students ages 8-14 code increasingly complex projects in WoofJS, and when they’re ready, start programming in a web-based environment. They’ll learn HTML & CSS and build their JavaScript skills to make projects that can run in any web browser. Maybe they’ll build a [to-do list](https://coding.space/v1/web/code/my-to-do-list-code.html) or [make a quiz](https://coding.space/v1/web/code/make-a-quiz-code.html)! As students get more familiar with JavaScript, they’ll switch into self-directed learning mode where they can try out other languages including Python to see what engages them most.
