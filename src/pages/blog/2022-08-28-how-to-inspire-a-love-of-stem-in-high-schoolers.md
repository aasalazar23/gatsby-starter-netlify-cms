      ## 1. Find them a mentor


      A good mentor can push a teenager in ways that parents sometimes can’t, providing a much-needed source of positive leadership and guidance at a time when teenagers are staking out their independence. In addition to helping teenagers build confidence and discipline, a rockstar STEM mentor can also spark a high schooler’s curiosity about STEM fields, shatter stereotypes about who practices STEM, and demonstrate the diversity of STEM career options. Does your teen admire an upperclassman who’s planning on majoring in Bio in college? Do they love their Physics teacher? Do they have a cool cousin working at a programming start-up? Any of these figures could make for an awesome mentor.

      ## 2. Learn on the job


      STEM internships can give high schoolers a chance to learn the ins & outs of a STEM career first-hand. Check out some local tech companies & STEM start-ups to see if they have high school internship programs. Who knows? Maybe your teenager will write an amazing college essay about how they discovered their love of coding during their summer at Verizon!

      ## 5. Introduce them to non-traditional STEM careers


      Not every high schooler wants to be a lifelong lab rat – but your teenager shouldn’t let that dissuade them from exploring STEM studies! If your teen loves sports, show them an article about sports statisticians. If they love Fortnite, ask them if they know about video game developers. If they’re a visual artist, hand them an interview with a Pixar animator. The STEM field is broad, and it can accommodate a huge range of personalities and interests!
