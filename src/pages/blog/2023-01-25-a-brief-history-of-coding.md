      ## Abacus


      The earliest known computing device is probably the [abacus](https://www.britannica.com/technology/abacus-calculating-device), which dates back at least to 1100 BCE. Often called the world’s first calculator, the abacus—which is still in use today—is the precursor to modern binary systems that power computers.

      ## Ada Lovelace


      Born in 1815, Ada Lovelace studied mathematics, which at the time was highly unusual for a woman. In 1843, Ada published an article about Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine, adding in her own extensive notes. She indicated that when the machine is fed a sequence of operations, with the help of signs and numbers, it could be competently used to solve various mathematical problems—in other words, she created the first algorithm intended to be processed by a machine!

Coding might seem like a modern phenomenon, but it has roots in computing processes that date back to the 1800s, WW1, and even ancient Sumeria.
