      ## Abacus


      The earliest known computing device is probably the [abacus](https://www.britannica.com/technology/abacus-calculating-device), which dates back at least to 1100 BCE. Often called the world’s first calculator, the abacus—which is still in use today—is the precursor to modern binary systems that power computers.

Coding might seem like a modern phenomenon, but it has roots in computing processes that date back to the 1800s, WW1, and even ancient Sumeria.
