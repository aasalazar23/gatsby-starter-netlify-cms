      # CodeCombat


      [CodeCombat](https://codecombat.com/) leverages kids’ love for fantasy stories — knights! dragons! heroes!—to help them drill coding fundamentals. Each lesson is introduced as a chapter in an overarching storyline; players defeat each level by coding, testing, and running the appropriate commands. Detailed characters coupled with beautifully designed maps and immersive sound make for one incredibly addictive coding game for kids. It’s important to note that, because CodeCombat’s lessons are designed for children aged 8 and up who have some degree of familiarity with coding, beginners might find the first few lessons confusing.

      # Elevator Saga


      For more experienced coders who have been learning JavaScript in our advanced classes, [Elevator Saga](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/) allows them to practice applying JavaScript knowledge in challenges related to transporting people in an elevator as efficiently as possible. The game starts out by challenging the player to move 15 people in less than a minute and gets progressively more difficult from there.

These projects range in difficulty from simple app-creation to complicated tech challenges, and you can choose to receive the project as a digital package or a physical kit delivered to your doorstep. Order one box to arrive during your vacation — or order three boxes to keep your child practicing their coding skills for a full summer away!

Summer is here! Coders of all ages are packing up their laptops and trading them for flippers & sunscreen as they embark on fun-filled vacations. So how do you keep your coding skills sharp while you’re away — without turning your vacation into summer school?

We at [TCS](https://www.thecodingspace.com/) think the secret lies in gamification. Gamification in learning involves using game-based elements such as scores, peer competition, and teamwork to drive engagement, helping students practice and hone their existing knowledge.

While a game can’t replace a proper coding class, it can be an incredible way to keep yourself on track during your time off. Coding games make practice fun — you might realize you’ve spent the last four hours reinforcing your coding skills without even realizing it. If you’re looking for something fun AND educational to occupy your time during long flights, long drives, or long afternoons by the pool this summer, check out this list of our favorite coding games below!
