      ## CHROME DINOSAUR GAME


      You’re probably familiar with the Chrome “no internet” dinosaur — it’s the little pixelated T-Rex that pops up on your browser when the connection peters out. But did you know that the "no internet" dinosaur is a mini game? Hit the space bar, and jump the scrolling cacti!

      ## BUZZFEED CONFETTI DROP


      On Buzzfeed's homepage, type the Konami code: up, up, down, down, right, left, right, left, b, a. Confetti will drop from the top of the page! The Konami Code (invented by Kazuhisa Hashimoto) originated as a cheat code—a sequence of button presses that unlocks secret features in a video game, usually making it easier to play.

This month, in honor of Easter, we're featuring our favorite easter eggs on the Internet!
