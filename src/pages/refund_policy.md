      ## Academic Year


      We are able to provide a full refund for cancelled registrations up to one
      week before the start of the term.


      After this point, we are no longer able to provide refunds. However, we
      can accommodate rescheduling. Class cancellations must be made 24 hrs in
      advance of the scheduled class to be eligible for rescheduling. We want to
      make sure our teachers have time to prepare, and know what to expect class
      to class, week to week. It makes for a better learning experience for our
      awesome students!


      Make-ups are subject to availability and require 3 days notice (i.e. for a
      Monday make-up, the request must be made by 4 pm on Friday). In addition,
      make-ups that are scheduled aren’t eligible for rescheduling a second
      time. Make-ups can't be rolled over to a future term.


      If an enrollment is changed after the start of a semester to one of lesser
      value, the difference will not be refunded.


      ## Mini Camps & Summer Camps


      We know sometimes plans change and things are more uncertain than usual
      right now. Cancellations made up to two weeks before the start date of
      your session are eligible for a full refund. Cancellations that are
      requested up to one week in advance are eligible for a 100% credit that
      can be used for a future camp or after-school session. We will not issue
      refunds or credits for cancellations requested less than a week in advance
      of the scheduled camp session date.


      Changes to dates can be made free of cost up to one week before the start
      date of your original camp session. No changes will be possible less than
      a week in advance of your original session’s start date.
