      ### Seasonal Programs


      Our spring, summer, and fall classes bring students together each week to
      make progress on individual projects, dive into hands-on activities, and
      explore opportunities for self-expression. By challenging students at
      their individual level to create projects as unique as they are, we
      underscore the power of personalized learning. And with our 4:1
      student-to-teacher ratio, students get the guidance they need to keep
      moving forward. Learn more about each semester by clicking below.
