      ## **Experience Levels**


      Whether your child is new to coding or already building their own websites, our classes will promote their growth within a safe, supportive environment. By challenging students at their individual level to create projects as unique as they are, we underscore the power of personalized learning. 


      While our classes are tailored to each of the four experience levels below, our student-centered approach creates a totally personalized education experience, allowing students to be challenged at their individual level and pace. No matter where they’ve started, we’re here to help them get where they want to go. 


      Not sure where your child should begin? Take our Placement Quiz for personalized recommendations based on your child’s current experience.

    mdContent: For young and first-time coders, we focus on fostering a welcoming
      and creative learning environment where students will develop a fluency
      with technology, and start forming crucial computational thinking patterns
      as they piece together their first lines of code. Students learn through
      specially curated activities in Code.org and advance into building
      animations and games in Scratch, a block-based programming language
      developed by MIT.

    mdContent: "In our Beginner course, we use Scratch challenge projects as our
      core curriculum. By starting in Scratch, a block-based coding language, we
      skip over the small syntactic details of text-based languages and cut
      directly to the difficult part of coding: formulating one’s ideas into a
      logical sequence of steps. Students can jump into this class with no prior
      programming knowledge and in just a few hours build a foundational
      understanding of core computer science concepts through building games and
      animations. As they progress through this course, they’ll continue to
      learn essential programming constructs and develop a computational thought
      process that will prepare them for more advanced material."

    mdContent: In our Intermediate course, students will create advanced projects in
      Scratch, a block-based coding language and move onto text-based
      programming in WoofJS, our JavaScript learning platform. WoofJS was
      developed by The Coding Space to allow students to leverage their existing
      Scratch knowledge and transition naturally into using HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript to make web-based projects. Students should come in with an
      advanced understanding of Scratch.
