      ## **Experience Levels**


      Whether your child is new to coding or already building their own websites, our classes will promote their growth within a safe, supportive environment. By challenging students at their individual level to create projects as unique as they are, we underscore the power of personalized learning. 


      While our classes are tailored to each of the four experience levels below, our student-centered approach creates a totally personalized education experience, allowing students to be challenged at their individual level and pace. No matter where they’ve started, we’re here to help them get where they want to go. 


      Not sure where your child should begin? Take our Placement Quiz for personalized recommendations based on your child’s current experience.

    mdContent: For young and first-time coders, we focus on fostering a welcoming
      and creative learning environment where students will develop a fluency
      with technology, and start forming crucial computational thinking patterns
      as they piece together their first lines of code. Students learn through
      specially curated activities in Code.org and advance into building
      animations and games in Scratch, a block-based programming language
      developed by MIT.
