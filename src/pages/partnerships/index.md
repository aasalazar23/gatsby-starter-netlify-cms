      ## Schools


      We currently partner with a variety of schools to bring project-based coding classes in both after-school and in-school formats. All of our teachers go through intensive training on the use of the Socratic Method, the ins and outs of our Scratch- and JavaScript-based coding curriculum, and classroom techniques that foster an environment conducive to learning at all paces and styles.

      #### Whether your school has a robust STEM program or would like to start
      introducing STEM to the student body, we have an option to suit your
      needs.


      * Host an event for your student body during the school day to celebrate a STEM holiday such as Hour of Code or Women in Tech Week or Code 4 Change. This is a great first step to expose your students to coding.

      * PTA Give Back Program serves as a PTA fundraiser and connects students with opportunities to code during school breaks.

      * Host an in-school or after-school class for students to more fully explore their interest in coding and take their skills to the next level.

      **Corporate Partnerships**


      We believe that everyone has a right to equitable education in a safe and inclusive learning environment and are committed to increasing access to our high-quality coding programs through corporate partnerships so that underrepresented children everywhere can surpass societal limitations and thrive. Our long-term goal as we work towards educational equity is to reach 50 percent of our students through scholarships and corporate partnerships.


      Curious to see our partnerships in action? Check out [a recent partnership with TradeZero](/blog/2022-02-08-community-partner-spotlight-tradezero/) to provide free coding classes to a Title I school in Brooklyn.
