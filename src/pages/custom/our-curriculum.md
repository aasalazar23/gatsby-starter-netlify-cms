      ### **Young Beginner through Intermediate**


      The cornerstone of our curriculum begins with [Scratch](https://www.thecodingspace.com/blog/2022-02-04-celebrating-scratch-during-scratchweek), a block-based programming language built by MIT. Students ages 8-10 will likely start here. Students under the age of 8 will likely start in Code.org, a pre-cursor to Scratch, completing several projects there before advancing to Scratch.
