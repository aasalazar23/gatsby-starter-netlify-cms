          ## The Coding Space Journey


          Our customized curriculum was created to inspire your child to achieve their maximum potential through multiple years of coding with us.


          Our student-centered approach combines project-based learning with unique platforms like WoofJS to create a personalized education experience, allowing students to be challenged at their individual level and pace.


          Through out their journey, students will gain continued exposure to computer science principles.


          ### **Typical Journey for a Coding Space student:**


          * Grade 1 - Young Beginner

          * Grade 2 - Young Beginner or Beginner

          * Grade 3 - Beginner or Intermediate

          * Grade 4 - Beginner or Intermediate

          * Grade 5 - Intermediate or Advanced

          * Grade 6 - Intermediate or Advanced

          * Grade 7 - Intermediate or Advanced

          * Grade 8 - Advanced or Teen Code

      ### **Young Beginner through Intermediate**


      The cornerstone of our curriculum begins withÂ [Scratch](https://www.thecodingspace.com/blog/2022-02-04-celebrating-scratch-during-scratchweek), a block-based programming language built by MIT. Students ages 8-10 will likely start here. Students under the age of 8 will likely start in Code.org, a pre-cursor to Scratch, completing several projects there before advancing to Scratch.


      #### **Skills Covered**


      * Sequential Evaluation

      * Events

      * Variables

      * Loops

      * Conditional Statements


      ### **Intermediate through Advanced**
