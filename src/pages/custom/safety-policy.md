      # Frequently Asked Questions


      **Are students required to be vaccinated?**


      > Yes. Students ages 5 and older must be fully vaccinated ﻿to attend in-person classes.


      **Are all employees fully vaccinated?**


      > Yes, all teachers and staff attending in person classes are fully vaccinated.


      **My child has Covid-19. When can they return to class?**


      > If your child tests positive for Covid-19, please do not have them come to class for 5 days. If they do not have symptoms, Day 0 is the day they were tested (not the day they received the positive test result). If they have symptoms, Day 0 is the day of symptom onset, regardless of when they tested positive. They may come to class after Day 5 if they have been fever free for 24 hours and their symptoms have improved if they had symptoms. A mask should be worn to class through Day 10. If they receive two sequential negative antigen tests 48 hours apart, they may remove their mask sooner than day 10 days.


      **Will there be remote learning for students who need to isolate due to Covid-19?**


      > In the event that a child tests positive and has to isolate, The Coding Space will offer a virtual class as an alternative to in person.


      **Will there be remote learning for students if classes are canceled due to Covid?**


      > If we make the decision to temporarily close in-person sessions due to rising Covid cases, virtual classes with the same schedule will replace in-person classes until we reopen.


      **Face Masks**


      > Face masks are optional in our coding classes. We encourage each of our families to choose what they feel is safest for their own child, and we will do our best to support your preference in class and remind students to keep their masks on if that is what their family decided.
