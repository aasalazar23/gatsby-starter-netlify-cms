      # Frequently Asked Questions


      **Are students required to be vaccinated?**


      > Yes. Students ages 5 and older must complete their first dose of the
      vaccine no later than Sunday 1/30/22. Families should continue to follow
      the manufacturer and vaccine site’s recommendations regarding completion
      of the second dose 21 days following the initial dose.


      **Are all employees fully vaccinated?**


      > Yes, all teachers and staff attending in person classes are fully
      vaccinated.


      **If my child is vaccinated, will they need to participate in a health
      screening?**


      > Yes. Upon arrival, and before being admitted to programming, all
      students must undergo a [Health
      Screening](https://thecodingspace.com/health-screening), which includes a
      series of questions and a temperature check.


      **Positive Screening Results**


      > If an individual presents a temperature greater than 100oF, the
      individual will not be permitted to attend class.

      >

      > If an individual answers in the affirmative to any of the screening
      questions, the individual will not be permitted to attend class and will
      be instructed to contact their healthcare provider for assessment and/or
      testing.

      >

      > Asymptomatic individuals who are fully vaccinated or have recovered from
      laboratory confirmed COVID-19 in the previous 3 months who screen positive
      for COVID-19 exposure may remain in class. Consideration will also be
      given to individuals experiencing known side effects of the COVID-19
      vaccine.


      **If my child is vaccinated, will they need to quarantine following
      exposure to a positive case?**


      > Consistent with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and New
      York State Department of Health (NYSDOH) guidance, vaccinated persons with
      exposure to someone with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 are not required
      to quarantine if they meet the following criteria:

      >

      > * Are fully vaccinated; and,

      > * Have remained asymptomatic since the current COVID-19 exposure.

      >

      > Vaccinated individuals must quarantine if they are members of the same
      household of the positive case with ongoing close contact during the
      period of infection.


      **What happens when The Coding Space learns of a positive COVID-19 test?**


      > Once The Coding Space is notified of a positive COVID-19 test, we
      immediately notify the parents/guardians of children who attend our
      programming at the location the infected person attended. In a separate
      email, we notify those who have had close contact with the infected
      person.


      **Who qualifies as a close contact?**


      > Close contact is defined as someone who was within 6 feet of an infected
      person (laboratory-confirmed or a clinically compatible illness) for a
      cumulative total of 10 minutes or more over a 24-hour period (for example,
      two individual 5-minute exposures for a total of 10 minutes).


      **Does my child need to quarantine if they were already positive for
      COVID-19 in the past?**


      > Consistent with CDC guidance from February 13, 2021, asymptomatic
      individuals who have previously been diagnosed with laboratory-confirmed
      COVID-19 and have since recovered, are not required to retest and
      quarantine within 3 months after the date of symptom onset from the
      initial COVID-19 infection or date of the first positive diagnostic test
      if asymptomatic during illness.


      **How long will my child be in quarantine?**


      > If an individual tests positive for COVID-19, the individual can return
      to class 10 days out from the start of the symptoms if they are fever-free
      for 24 hours without fever reducing medication and their symptoms have
      improved.

      >

      > In the event that the student came in close contact with a person with
      COVID-19, the student must be quarantined unless they are fully vaccinated
      or have been previously-positive in the past 90 days. Vaccinated
      individuals must quarantine if they are members of the same household of
      the positive case with ongoing close contact during the period of
      infection.

      >

      > Consistent with guidance from the CDC, unvaccinated students who are
      required to quarantine following an exposure to a positive COVID-19 case
      may now reduce their duration of quarantine by receiving a negative PCR
      test. The New York City Department of Health requires a quarantine of 10
      days for unvaccinated individuals exposed to COVID-19 unless the exposed
      individual receives a negative COVID-19 test on day five or later. A
      negative test conducted on day five or later will allow students to return
      to class after day seven of their quarantine. The test must be a molecular
      test (such as a PCR test) or antigen test performed in a doctor’s office,
      clinic, or other testing site.

      >

      > Individuals must continue daily symptom monitoring through Day 14 and
      should continue strict adherence to all recommended non-pharmaceutical
      interventions, including hand hygiene and the use of face coverings. If
      any symptoms develop, individuals should immediately self-isolate and
      contact their healthcare provider to report this change in clinical status
      and determine if they should seek testing.


      **Can my child use an at-home test to 'test out' of the 10-day
      quarantine?**


      > Yes, but they must complete two at-home tests. If using two at-home
      tests, the first test must be performed at least five days after your last
      exposure, and the second test must be performed 24 hours after the first
      test (or longer based on the manufacturer’s instructions).


      **Will there be remote learning for students placed in quarantine?**


      > In the event that a child has to quarantine, The Coding Space will offer
      a virtual class as an alternative to in person.


      **Will there be remote learning for students if classes are cancelled due
      to Covid?**


      > If we make the decision to temporarily close in-person sessions due to
      rising Covid cases, virtual classes with the same schedule will replace
      until we reopen.


      **Will The Coding Space close its in-person classes if public schools
      close due to increasing COVID-19 positivity rates?**


      > The Coding Space will not make decisions in lockstep with Departments of
      Education. We will certainly abide by mandated governmental guidance or
      direction regarding closure and will communicate further details to you.


      **Physical Distancing**


      > Physical distancing requirements are a minimum of three feet between
      students.

      >

      > A minimum of six feet of distance must be maintained when eating snacks
      or drinking.


      **Shared Supplies**


      > Supplies and materials that cannot be designated for single-student use
      will be wiped with cleaning wipes between uses.


      **Face Coverings**


      > All individuals in our spaces must wear face coverings, regardless of
      vaccination status. The Coding Space will have cloth face coverings
      available for each student and employee available. No one is required to
      wear the The Coding Space-provided face covering, but a face covering must
      be worn as indicated below:

      >

      > * Students, employees, parents, guardians, and caregivers: face
      coverings are required when in class unless in a single-occupant room,
      when outdoors, or when eating/drinking.

      >

      > All students and employees must adhere to the [CDC’s guidance on washing
      cloth face
      coverings](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wash-cloth-face-coverings.html).
      If wearing a disposable face covering, the manufacturer should be
      consulted to determine appropriate use.

      >

      > Acceptable face coverings include cloth-based face coverings (e.g,
      homemade sewn, quick cut), N-95 or KN-95 respirators, and surgical masks
      that cover both the nose and mouth. Bandanas or face masks with exhalation
      vents or valves are not considered acceptable face coverings. Acceptable
      face coverings should have at least two layers (e.g. 2-ply) and fit snug
      against your face without gaping openings around the edges. If choosing to
      wear a face shield, it must be worn in addition to a face covering. Face
      shields alone are not considered adequate protection against COVID-19.
      Additional information about how to select, wear, and clean your mask may
      be
      found [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/about-face-coverings.html).


      **Following a Confirmed Case of COVID-19**


      > Facilities will clean and disinfect exposed areas in the event an
      individual is confirmed to have COVID-19 with such cleaning and
      disinfection to include, at a minimum, all heavy transit areas and
      high-touch surfaces. The School will adhere to the CDC guidance
      on [Cleaning and Disinfecting Your
      Facility](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/disinfecting-building-facility.html).
      Once the area has been appropriately cleaned, it will be reopened for use.
      If more than seven days have passed since the person who is suspected or
      confirmed to have COVID-19 visited or used the facility, additional
      cleaning and disinfection is not necessary, but routine cleaning and
      disinfection will continue.
