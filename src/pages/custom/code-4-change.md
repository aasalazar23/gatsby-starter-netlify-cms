      ## Challenge: Build a Better World


      Coding truly is a superpower. It can help make us safer, more sustainable, and more equitable. Used for good, it can truly help us create a stronger world for everyone.


      This spring, Code 4 Change: Build a Better World asks our coders to use their powers for good in addressing a global issue. Drawing on the [UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), coders will tap into their innovation, creativity, and resourcefulness to develop creative, tech-based solutions to real world problems like hunger, poverty, equality, and more. Get involved today!

      - title: Who is invited to participate?
        mdContent: Coders of all skill levels are encouraged to sign up. This event is
          free and open to the general public and kids of all ages. Coders who
          are signed up for TCS spring classes will have the added benefit of
          class time to work on their project as well as personalized support
          from our instructors.
      - title: What will kids be making?
        mdContent: Kids will be asked to choose one of the [UN’s 17 Sustainable
          Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) to focus on. They will
          then create a project, game, or presentation of their choice using a
          programming language like Scratch, WoofJS, or another to propose a
          solution to this issue. We recommend that coders include clear
          visuals, easy-to-follow instructions, simple rules, and an
          approachable pace.
      - title: When is Code 4 Change happening?
        mdContent: "Code 4 Change: Build a Better World kicks off officially in
          May,  but kids are invited to begin coding their projects as soon as
          they sign up. Coders will have four official weeks to code their
          projects before turning them in for voting."
      - title: "Where does C4C: Build a Better World happen?"
        mdContent: This challenge is entirely virtual, so kids can participate wherever
          they have access to a computer and the internet. TCS students will
          have the opportunity to work on their projects during class, but we
          love when students work on their projects at home (parental decisions
          about screen time permitting), so you may find them bringing it up in
          conversation with you as they work or even asking for your help.
          Global issues affect all of us, so working together to find solutions
          is expected and encouraged.
      - title: Why Build a Better World?
        mdContent: >-
          It’s no secret that coding is becoming a critical skill for success.
          With the world rapidly growing more tech-focused and data-driven, the
          importance of coding and other digital literacy skills will only
          increase. However, we at TCS believe that coding is more than just a
          tool for individual advancement — instead, we focus on the
          intersection of coding and community service, bolstered by the belief
          that coding can be a tool for positive social change. Through Code 4
          Change, we aim to support a new generation of global leaders working
          at the intersection of technology and social impact.


          That’s why we’re empowering our students to put their ideas into action. How can we use code to distribute food to the hungry? To stop future pandemics? To support the pursuit of racial equity? Whether it’s on a local or global level, kids will have the chance to program prototypes of their creative solutions to real issues facing our world.
      - title: How will projects be judged?
        mdContent: All completed projects will be hosted on the TCS website. Everyone
          will have the opportunity to vote for Coders’ Choice. The TCS team
          will reveal this winner, as well as winners in several technical
          categories chosen by our TCS instructors, during a live virtual event
          in June.
      - title: How can kids get involved?
        mdContent: Participating coders come back to this website to sign up in
          February. Fill out the form at the top of our page to get notified
          when registration opens![sign up
          here](https://code4change.thecodingspace.com) between Monday, February
          21st and Sunday, April 3rd.
      - title: How can parents help support their C4C coders?
        mdContent: We encourage you to explore the [Sustainable Development
          Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) with your children and to engage in
          conversations with them about what those goals are trying to address.
          Check out [this
          resource](https://cecp.co/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-the-sustainable-development-goals-sdgs/) about
          discussing SDGs with kids, and think about what goals they may already
          have a passion for or might like to know more about.

      ### The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals


      What global issue are you passionate about solving? Below you’ll find the 17 Sustainable Development Goals created by the UN. We encourage you to [visit their website](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) to learn more about each issue. Then, consider your passions: are you dedicated to protecting wildlife and the environment? Making sure people have enough to eat and the resources they need to thrive? Once you’ve decided on your project, start thinking about how you would solve it and how you can explore that solution in a game, project, or presentation.

      ### Sharing Instructions


      #### Scratch


      After creating and completing your project on Scratch, you will need to share it publicly. To do so, navigate to your Project Page. If you can’t find your Project Page, simply save your project, then go to "My Stuff" and click on the project from there.


      If you see this banner, just click Share!


      ![Code 4 Change banner to share](/img/c4c-share.png "Code 4 Change banner to share")


      If you do not see this banner, then either your project is already shared or your account has not been fully activated. To check if your account is fully activated, go to your Profile page by clicking on your username on the top bar and selecting Profile.


      If you see this banner, your account needs to be activated:


      ![Code 4 Change confirm email banner](/img/c4c-email-confirm.png "Code 4 Change confirm email banner")


      If you made the account with The Coding Space, we can help you. Just email us at support@thecodingspace.com and we’ll help you to fully activate your account. Otherwise, you need to activate your account using the email you registered it with.


      To test your project’s sharing capabilities, simply click the link on the Project Page which says Copy Link and copy the link into the browser of an incognito window to make sure it is publicly visible. If you can see the project when not signed into the account that made it, your link is ready to submit!


      #### WoofJS


      All WoofJS projects are public. Just click the fullscreen button, then copy the URL in your browser’s bar. It will look like this one: <https://woofjs.com/full.html#c4cexample>
