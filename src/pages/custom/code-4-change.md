      ## Challenge: Protect Our Planet


      Coding truly is a superpower. It can help make us safer, more sustainable, and more equitable. Used for good, it can truly help us create a better world for everyone.


      This year's Code 4 Change Challenge asks our coders to use their powers to help protect our planet. Drawing on key [UN Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), coders will tap into their innovation, creativity, and resourcefulness to develop creative, tech-based solutions. 


      Follow [our instructions here](https://coding.space/launchpad/007e74ca-cb1a-48be-976e-1ee4e76bd7ed) to research, plan, and create. When you're ready, submit your project via the link below. If you're in the NYC area, visit us on May 13th for a workshop so we can create a better world together! (RSVP below.)

      - title: What will kids be making?
        mdContent: >-
          This year, we're asking kids to choose a Sustainable Development Goal
          from the list below to brainstorm solutions for protecting our
          planet: 


          S﻿DG #2: [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2)


          S﻿DG #6: [Clean Water and Sanitation](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6)


          S﻿DG #12: [Responsible Consumption](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) 


          SDG #13: [Climate Action](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)


          SDG #14: [Life Below Water](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14)


          SDG #15: [Life on Land](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)\

          \

          They will then create a project, game, or presentation of their choice using a programming language like Scratch, WoofJS, or another to propose a solution to this issue. We recommend that coders include clear visuals, easy-to-follow instructions, simple rules, and an approachable pace.
      - title: When is Code 4 Change happening?
        mdContent: "Code 4 Change: Protect Our Planet is happening right now! Submit
          your project anytime until June 7, 2024 to have your project featured

      - title: "Where does C4C: Protect Our Planet happen?"
        mdContent: This challenge is entirely virtual, so kids can participate wherever
          they have access to a computer and the internet. We are also holding
          an in-person workshop on Monday, May 13th at our Upper East Side, NYC

      - title: Why Code 4 Change?
        mdContent: >-
          It’s no secret that coding is becoming a critical skill for success.
          With the world rapidly growing more tech-focused and data-driven, the
          importance of coding and other digital literacy skills will only
          increase. However, we at The Coding Space believe that coding is more
          than just a tool for individual advancement — instead, we focus on the
          intersection of coding and community service, bolstered by the belief
          that coding can be a tool for positive social change. Through Code 4
          Change, we aim to support a new generation of global leaders working
          at the intersection of technology and social impact.


          That’s why we’re empowering our students to put their ideas into action. Whether it’s on a local or global level, kids will have the chance to program prototypes of their creative solutions to real issues facing our world.
      - title: How can kids get started?
        mdContent: H﻿ead to [this
          link](https://coding.space/launchpad/007e74ca-cb1a-48be-976e-1ee4e76bd7ed)
          for instructions on how to get started and submit your work!
      - title: How can parents help support their C4C coders?
        mdContent: We encourage you to explore the [Sustainable Development
          Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) with your children and to engage in
          conversations with them about what those goals are trying to address.
          Check out [this
          resource](https://cecp.co/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-the-sustainable-development-goals-sdgs/) about
          discussing SDGs with kids, and think about what goals they may already
          have a passion for or might like to know more about.
