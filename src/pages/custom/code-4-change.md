      ## Challenge: Build a Better World


      Coding truly is a superpower. It can help make us safer, more sustainable, and more equitable. Used for good, it can truly help us create a stronger world for everyone.


      This spring, Code 4 Change: Build a Better World asks our coders to use their powers for good in addressing a global issue. Drawing on the [UN’s Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), coders will tap into their innovation, creativity, and resourcefulness to develop creative, tech-based solutions to real world problems like hunger, poverty, equality, and more. Get involved today!

        mdContent: Coders of all skill levels are encouraged to sign up. This event is
          free and open to the general public and kids of all ages.
      - title: What will kids be making?
        mdContent: >-
          Kids will be asked to choose one of these Sustainable Development
          Goals to focus on:


          S﻿DG #2: [Zero Hunger](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal2)


          S﻿DG #6: [Clean Water and Sanitation](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal6)


          S﻿DG #12: [Responsible Consumption](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal12) 


          SDG #13: [Climate Action](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal13)


          SDG #14: [Life Below Water](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal14)


          SDG #15: [Life on Land](https://sdgs.un.org/goals/goal15)\

          \

          They will then create a project, game, or presentation of their choice using a programming language like Scratch, WoofJS, or another to propose a solution to this issue. We recommend that coders include clear visuals, easy-to-follow instructions, simple rules, and an approachable pace.
      - title: When is Code 4 Change happening?
        mdContent: "Code 4 Change: Build a Better World kicks off officially in
          April,  but kids are invited to begin coding their projects as soon as
          they sign up."
      - title: "Where does C4C: Build a Better World happen?"
        mdContent: This challenge is entirely virtual, so kids can participate wherever
          they have access to a computer and the internet.
      - title: Why Build a Better World?
        mdContent: >-
          It’s no secret that coding is becoming a critical skill for success.
          With the world rapidly growing more tech-focused and data-driven, the
          importance of coding and other digital literacy skills will only
          increase. However, we at TCS believe that coding is more than just a
          tool for individual advancement — instead, we focus on the
          intersection of coding and community service, bolstered by the belief
          that coding can be a tool for positive social change. Through Code 4
          Change, we aim to support a new generation of global leaders working
          at the intersection of technology and social impact.


          That’s why we’re empowering our students to put their ideas into action. How can we use code to distribute food to the hungry? To stop future pandemics? To support the pursuit of racial equity? Whether it’s on a local or global level, kids will have the chance to program prototypes of their creative solutions to real issues facing our world.
      - title: How will projects be judged?
        mdContent: All completed projects will be hosted on the TCS website. Everyone
          will have the opportunity to vote for Coders’ Choice. The TCS team
          will reveal this winner, as well as winners in several technical
          categories chosen by our TCS instructors, during a live virtual event
          in June.
      - title: How can kids get involved?
        mdContent: Fill out the form at the top of our page to starting your Code 4
          Change journey!
      - title: How can parents help support their C4C coders?
        mdContent: We encourage you to explore the [Sustainable Development
          Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) with your children and to engage in
          conversations with them about what those goals are trying to address.
          Check out [this
          resource](https://cecp.co/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-the-sustainable-development-goals-sdgs/) about
          discussing SDGs with kids, and think about what goals they may already
          have a passion for or might like to know more about.

      ### The UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals


      What global issue are you passionate about solving? Below you’ll find the 17 Sustainable Development Goals created by the UN. We encourage you to [visit their website](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) to learn more about each issue. Then, consider your passions: are you dedicated to protecting wildlife and the environment? Making sure people have enough to eat and the resources they need to thrive? Once you’ve decided on your project, start thinking about how you would solve it and how you can explore that solution in a game, project, or presentation.
