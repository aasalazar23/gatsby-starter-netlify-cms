      ## Every staff member, teacher, and student must do the following before
      engaging in programming at The Coding Space:


      1. Have your temperature taken using a contactless thermometer. If you have a temperature above 100 degrees, you will not be allowed to attend class.

      2. Answer a questionnaire that determines whether the individual has:



         * Tested positive through a diagnostic test for COVID-19 in the past 10 days;
         * To the best of their knowledge, been in close contact in the past 10 days with anyone who has tested positive through a diagnostic test for COVID-19;
         * Experienced any symptoms of COVID-19, including sore throat, cough, fever, chills, shortness of breath, gastrointestinal symptoms, or loss of taste or smell, or come in close contact with anyone exhibiting these symptoms in the past 10 days

      In the event an individual exhibits signs of COVID exposure or symptoms during check-in or during class, that individual is separated from others and The Coding Space staff, in consultation with The Coding Space administration, determine appropriate action, which may include arrangements to send the individual home.
