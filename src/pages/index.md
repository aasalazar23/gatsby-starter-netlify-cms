    title: I love it here because in my other classes and camps, they just give the
      answers to you. Here I get to figure it out for myself. It’s more exciting
      because I learned it myself.
  - content: Jill, NYC
    title: The Coding Space has opened up a whole new world for our daughter, which
      was especially needed when she couldn’t see friends in person. Her classes
      are the highlight of her week, and it’s so incredible to watch her
      progress.

    title: My son Aiden said it was the best camp he’s ever done and he absolutely
      loved everything he learned about coding. The instructors were really
      excited and knowledgeable.
