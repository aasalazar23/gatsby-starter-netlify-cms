    Blast off this fall with The Coding Space Virtual Classes. Working
    one-on-one or in small groups, your child’s coding journey can now continue
    anywhere. Our unique fall 2020 group classes program balances screen time
    with hands-on activities and opportunities to create and explore, even in
    your own house. Our program provides social interaction so that students can
    make new friends near and far, all while experiencing our signature 4:1
    student to teacher ratio ensuring personalized attention when they need it.
    We’re on a mission to help kids develop creative thinking skills,
    confidence, and self-expression through learning to code.

  of abilities: from complete beginners to students already building
  applications in JavaScript and Python. We have also launched half semester
  plans to fit your flexible schedule this Fall."

        We’re not your typical coding class. Our classes are designed to foster
        intellectual confidence, growth mindset and computational thinking
        skills.

    Kaldi is the ultimate spot for coffee lovers who want to learn about their
    java’s origin and support the farmers that grew it. We take coffee
    production, roasting and brewing seriously and we’re glad to pass that
    knowledge to anyone. This is an edit via identity...

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
