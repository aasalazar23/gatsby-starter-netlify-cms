    Blast off this fall with The Coding Space Virtual Classes. Working
    one-on-one or in small groups, your child’s coding journey can now continue
    anywhere. Our unique fall 2020 group classes program balances screen time
    with hands-on activities and opportunities to create and explore, even in
    your own house. Our program provides social interaction so that students can
    make new friends near and far, all while experiencing our signature 4:1
    student to teacher ratio ensuring personalized attention when they need it.
    We’re on a mission to help kids develop creative thinking skills,
    confidence, and self-expression through learning to code.
