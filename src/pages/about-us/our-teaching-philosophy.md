      ## What We Do and How We Do It




      Our teaching philosophy is derived from our dedication to student-centered learning and unique teaching methods:

        content: "By challenging students at their individual level to create projects
          as unique as they are, we underscore the power of personalized
          learning. And with our 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio, students get the
          guidance they need to keep moving forward. "
      - title: Unique Teaching Methods
        content: "From the Socratic method to our signature Untutorials, our specialized
          curriculum and teaching methods are centered around asking questions
          that empower students to explore problems, discover solutions, and
          grow as thinkers, learners, and leaders. "

        mdContent: In our classrooms, students learn entirely through creating projects.
          Projects allow students to work at their own pace on building critical
          thinking and problem solving skills while simultaneously picking up
          the hard skills of coding. Students create games in Scratch, progress
          to websites in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as work in many
          other tools and languages depending on what keeps them both engaged
          and challenged. It is the job of our teachers to make sure that
          students find projects that are both engaging and challenging at the
          same time.

          Unlike virtually all other coding curriculums, The Coding Space
          doesn’t use follow-along instructions. Instead, we employ Untutorials:
          fun and engaging games, websites, or apps that students are challenged
          to figure out how to build. 




          Untutorials list the high-level tasks students need to complete the project, but intentionally leave out how to accomplish those tasks. Students develop strong grit, determination, and problem-solving skills by figuring out the rest via tinkering, Googling, asking a friend, and iterating towards a solution, all while developing deep insights and intuition of high-level concepts.
