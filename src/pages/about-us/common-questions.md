        title: My student has programmed before. Will this class still be challenging
          for him or her?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: Yes, we offer curriculum that would be challenging and engaging to
          all students who aren't already professional software engineers or
          Computer Science majors in college.

        title: Does my child need to bring a computer?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: We provide computers for students whey they are physically in person
          in classes. However, some students choose to bring their own computers
          because they are more comfortable working on them. This can change
          based on location, so please check with the instructor.

        mdContent: There is no required homework. However, teachers may recommend that
          students work on something at home and students often freely choose to
          continue working on their projects at home for fun.

          **Academic Year Refund Policy:**


          We are able to provide a full refund for cancelled registrations up to one week before the start of the term.


          After this point, we are no longer able to provide refunds. However, we can accommodate rescheduling. Class cancellations must be made 24 hrs in advance of the scheduled class to be eligible for rescheduling. We want to make sure our teachers have time to prepare, and know what to expect from class to class, week to week. It makes for a better learning experience for our awesome students! 


          For scheduling make-ups, we require 3 days notice (i.e. for a Monday make-up, the request must be made by 4 pm on Friday). In addition, make-ups that are scheduled aren’t eligible for rescheduling a second time. Make-ups can't be rolled over to a future semester.  


          **Summer Camp Refund Policy:**


          We know sometimes plans change and things are more uncertain than usual right now. Cancellations made up to two weeks before the start date of your session are eligible for a full refund. Cancellations that are requested up to one week in advance are eligible for a 100% credit that can be used for a future summer or after-school session. We will not issue refunds or credits for cancellations requested less than a week in advance of the scheduled camp session date.


          Changes to dates can be made free of cost up to one week before the start date of your original camp session. No changes will be possible less than a week in advance of your original session’s start date.

        title: What will my child learn?

          On the face of it, your child will learn how to make
          increasingly-complex Scratch and JavaScript applications, but behind
          the scenes they will be growing so much more than that.


          At Coding Space, our goal is to teach critical thinking, problem solving, and to instill a life-long love of learning, building, creating, and growing. We help students develop grit and intellectual confidence, two character strengths that will aid students greatly in other STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) subjects. Our students learn the thought patterns and mindsets of programmers, including modeling, debugging, sequential thinking, top-down design, the design processes, test-driven development, and more.

        title: What programming languages will my child be learning?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: Learning to code isn’t about learning the syntax of a particular
          language, it’s about learning how to think like a programmer and have
          the foundational skills necessary to learn any new programming
          language within a day, if not sooner. While our students’ projects are
          made primarily in Scratch for beginner students and JavaScript for
          advanced students, our larger goal is to teach kids the skills they
          will need to tackle any programming language. To learn more about our
          curriculum, please click [here.](/about-us/curriculum-faqs)

        title: What makes your class different from other coding classes?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: We teach coding using the Socratic Method, allowing our students to
          discover the solution independently. To read more about what makes our
          Approach different, go here.
