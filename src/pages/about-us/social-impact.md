      **Advocating for Racial Justice**




      The Coding Space is committed to being anti-racist advocates. Our staff and students reflect the many faces, cultures, and walks of life that proudly make up our world, and we are better because of it. We acknowledge that people of color have been historically under-represented in the tech industry, STEM fields, and power structures in society at large. We at The Coding Space aim to address this reality through the lens of our program and ensure that we are providing access and opportunity in the following ways:




      1. Maintain a staff of more than 50% Black, Indigenous, People of Color that reflects or expands the racial make-up of the area we serve. In New York City, for instance, that is ensuring our New York City team is at least 25% Black.

      2. Address the fact that racial equity is inextricably linked to economic opportunity through the following initiatives:

         * Develop teacher-in-training programming that provides job opportunities to people of color with non-traditional work and educational backgrounds.

           * Widen access to our program through our scholarship program, which aims to award need-based scholarships to 25% of our student body.
