        title: What will my child learn at The Coding Space?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: >-
          On the face of it, your child will learn how to make
          increasingly-complex Scratch and JavaScript applications, but behind
          the scenes they will be growing so much more than that.


          At The Coding Space, our goal is to teach critical thinking, problem solving, and to instill a life-long love of learning, building, creating, and growing. We help students develop grit and intellectual confidence, two character strengths that will aid students greatly in other STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) subjects. Our students learn the thought patterns and mindsets of programmers, including modeling, debugging, sequential thinking, top-down design, the design processes, test-driven development, and more.

        title: What programming languages will my child be learning?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: Learning to code isn’t about learning the syntax of a particular
          language, it’s about learning how to think like a programmer and have
          the foundational skills necessary to learn any new programming
          language within a day, if not sooner. While our students’ projects are
          made primarily in Scratch for beginner students and JavaScript for
          advanced students, our larger goal is to teach kids the skills they
          will need to tackle any programming language.

          The cornerstone of our curriculum begins with
          [Scratch](/blog/2022-02-04-celebrating-scratch-during-scratchweek), a
          block-based programming language built by MIT.


          Parents often worry that because block-based programming is quicker to start coding, it is less educational than text-based programming. It’s actually the opposite! Learning the syntax of a programming language is a tedious and rote task that doesn’t engage students’ critical thinking skills. Block-based programming skips directly to the difficult part of coding: formulating one’s ideas into a logical sequence of steps.

        title: What happens after Scratch?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: "Our team at The Coding Space has spent thousands of hours creating
          the best possible solution to this answer:
          [WoofJS](/blog/2022-02-04-whats-woofjs-got-to-do-with-it). We
          developed WoofJS as an intermediate step, allowing students to
          leverage their existing Scratch knowledge while using a web
          programming language. For every block in Scratch, we created an
          equivalent text-based command in JavaScript, thus creating a bridge
          between the two languages and making the transition as seamless as
          possible."

        title: When will my child move on from Scratch?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: >-
          We strongly believe that programmers of all ages benefit from starting
          in a block-based programming environment like Scratch. However,
          students often want to move to text-based programming before they’ve
          exhausted what they can learn in Scratch. While we do encourage
          students to stick with Scratch as long as possible, we don’t hold kids
          back if they want to switch to text-based programming. As often as
          not, students realize text-based programming isn’t as fun as they
          expected and switch right back to Scratch, wisely leaving text-based
          programming for another day.


          While Scratch is a complete programming language, it doesn’t have nearly as many features as JavaScript, HTML and CSS. When a student’s Scratch projects go beyond a couple hundred blocks of code, it’s about time to move to JavaScript through WoofJS. There they can learn to use arrays, functions that return values, first-class functions, variable scoping, functional programming principles, and much more.

        title: What's after WoofJS?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: In our Advanced Classes, students can explore their creativity
          through coding. As they transition out of WoofJS, they’ll build
          web-based projects using HTML/CSS and JavaScript. From there, they can
          dive deeper into the JavaScript language or experiment with other
          languages and frameworks.

        title: What projects will my child make?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: >-
          We believe that our students should have the chance to make projects
          as unique as they are. Unlike virtually all other coding curriculums,
          The Coding Space doesn’t use follow-along instructions. Instead, we
          employ Untutorials: fun and engaging games, websites, or apps that
          students are challenged to figure out how to build.


          Untutorials list the high-level tasks students need to complete the project, but intentionally leave out how to accomplish those tasks. Students develop strong grit, determination, and problem-solving skills by figuring out the rest via tinkering, Googling, asking a friend, and iterating towards a solution, all while developing deep insights and intuition of high-level concepts.

        title: How many instructors are there per student?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: Our students thrive in small group settings, which is why we maintain
          small student to teacher ratios, ranging from four to seven students
          per teacher, to ensure a personalized learning experience for every
          student.

        title: When will my child learn “real” programming?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: "Ever since programming was invented, there have been debates about
          what “real” programming is. Fortunately, there is a simple criteria to
          determine if something is a “real” programming language. A programming
          language is “Turing Complete” if it can simulate any other programming
          language. At The Coding Space, we teach two Turing Complete
          programming languages: Scratch and JavaScript, and two non-Turing
          Complete languages: HTML and CSS. In other words, Scratch is “real”
          programming—it has variables, loops, boolean logic, objects,
          message-passing, conditional branching, etc.—making it a foundational
          tool for our coders."

        title: Do you teach Python?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: >-
          While some of our teachers have knowledge of Python and may be able to
          help students with it as an independent study, Python does not have an
          official place in The Coding Space curriculum.


          In its place, we teach JavaScript which is very similar to Python. However, it has one huge plus: it is the language of the web. As such, JavaScript is by far the most popular programming language [\[StackOverflow, 2019]](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019). 


          JavaScript is wonderfully versatile. You can code in JavaScript on any device that can access the web, including phones, tablets, and Chromebooks. You can share your code via a simple link without requiring viewers to install software. JavaScript is designed for visual creations, such as websites, animations, and games. There are no core computer science concepts that students learn in Python that they don’t learn in JavaScript. And, with the largest and most active developer community, it continues to advance very quickly.

        title: What will my child be able to do after this course?
        textColor: "#264548"
        mdContent: All of our classes are self-paced, so there are no predetermined
          final projects or skills at the end of our courses. Generally
          speaking, your student will be able to build complex Scratch and
          JavaScript applications, from Flappy Bird to Instagram and anything in
          between. Because our courses are project-based but not
          tutorial-driven, after your child completes a Coding Space project,
          they will have the ability to create their own projects at home.
