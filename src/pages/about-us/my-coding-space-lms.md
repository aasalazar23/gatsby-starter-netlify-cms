      My Coding Space is a custom-built platform for The Coding Space students.
      From tracking their progress in projects and classes, to providing
      opportunities to grow their skills outside of the classroom and build
      community, My Coding Space is a powerful partner for our students, and
      their parents, throughout their coding journey. Read more about our
      platform
