    heading: How The Coding Space Got Started
    mdContent: >-
      Our story begins in 2015. Driven by a desire to make an impact in the
      lives of others, founders Eli Kariv and Steve Krouse launched The Coding
      Space—an afterschool program where students would learn how to tackle
      challenges independently through learning to code. They envisioned
      unconventional coding classes where students could control the pace of
      their learning while developing intellectual confidence, a growth mindset,
      self-expression, and computational thinking skills. Within the first two
      years, The Coding Space doubled in size, adding classes in multiple
      locations and schools around New York City as well as several full-time
      staff members.


      In 2019, [Private Prep](https://privateprep.com/), a leading test prep and tutoring company, acquired The Coding Space adding infrastructure support through human resources, technology, financial services, and more. As a part of the Private Prep family of brands, The Coding Space continues to focus on what it does best: creating a student-centered environment where children are architects of their own learning, and coding helps make that possible.

      their maximum potential. The computational thinking skills and
      intellectual confidence we instill in our students is not only the means
      of learning to code; it’s the basis for a child’s curiosity and
      creativity. Our student-centered approach combines project-based learning
      with unique platforms like WoofJS and our proprietary Learning Management
      System to create a totally personalized education experience, allowing
      students to be challenged at their individual level and pace.

      At The Coding Space, we view failure as one step closer to success. We
      offer a safe space that fosters freedom to take risks and make mistakes
      and within it a teaching methodology that values questions over answers
      and celebrates the feeling of being stuck. Coding is our medium of choice
      because it inherently teaches the beliefs, attitudes, and mental models
      for good learning, problem solving, and critical thinking. Every moment of
      frustration, every bug, every roadblock, is an opportunity to learn
      something new and develop confidence in one’s ability to tackle the next
      hurdle.


      We promote the growth of every teacher, staff member, and student that enters our space in ways they most value. For our students, that means building a sense of community through collaboration and interaction that promotes their social and emotional development, fostering positive student-teacher relationships that meet the needs of each student at an individual level, and communicating progress, setbacks, and learning needs to best support them. For our teachers and staff, we advocate for their growth through providing professional development and training, including how to become better teachers and coders, and offering ongoing support and mentorship to help them along their individual journeys.
