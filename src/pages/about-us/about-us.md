    heading: How The Coding Space Got Started
    mdContent: >-
      Our story begins in 2015. Driven by a desire to make an impact in the
      lives of others, founders Eli Kariv and Steve Krouse launched The Coding
      Space—an afterschool program where students would learn how to tackle
      challenges independently through learning to code. They envisioned
      unconventional coding classes where students could control the pace of
      their learning while developing intellectual confidence, a growth mindset,
      self-expression, and computational thinking skills. Within the first two
      years, The Coding Space doubled in size, adding classes in multiple
      locations and schools around New York City as well as several full-time
      staff members.




      In 2019, Private Prep, a leading test prep and tutoring company, acquired The Coding Space adding infrastructure support through human resources, technology, financial services, and more. As a part of the Private Prep family of brands, The Coding Space continues to focus on what it does best: creating a student-centered environment where children are architects of their own learning and coding helps make that possible.
