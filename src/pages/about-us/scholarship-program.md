      # **Scholarships With The Coding Space**




      We believe that everyone has a right to equitable education in a safe and
      inclusive learning environment and are committed to increasing access to
      our high-quality coding programs. Our scholarship program accounts for 25
      percent of the students we teach. Our long-term goal as we work towards
      educational equity is to reach 50 percent of our students through at-cost
      and pro-bono services.
