      ## Challenge: Build a Better World


      Coding truly is a superpower. It can help make us safer, more sustainable, and more equitable. Used for good, it can truly help us create a stronger world for everyone.


      This spring, Code 4 Change: Build a Better World asks our coders to use their powers for good in addressing a global issue. Drawing on the [UN’s 17 Sustainable Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals), coders will tap into their innovation, creativity, and resourcefulness to develop creative, tech-based solutions to real world problems like hunger, poverty, equality, and more. Get involved today!

    list:
      - title: Who is invited to participate?
        mdContent: Coders of all skill levels are encouraged to sign up. This event is
          free and open to the general public and kids of all ages. Coders who
          are signed up for TCS spring classes will have the added benefit of
          class time to work on their project as well as personalized support
          from our instructors.
      - title: What will kids be making?
        mdContent: Kids will be asked to choose one of the [UN’s 17 Sustainable
          Development Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) to focus on. They will
          then create a project, game, or presentation of their choice using a
          programming language like Scratch, WoofJS, or another to propose a
          solution to this issue. We recommend that coders include clear
          visuals, easy-to-follow instructions, simple rules, and an
          approachable pace.
      - title: When is Code 4 Change happening?
        mdContent: "Code 4 Change: Build a Better World kicks off officially on Monday,
          April 5th, but kids are invited to begin coding their projects as soon
          as they sign up. Coders will have four weeks to code their projects
          before turning them in by Friday, May 7th. Voting begins Saturday, May
          8th."
      - title: "Where does C4C: Build a Better World happen?"
        mdContent: This challenge is entirely virtual, so kids can participate wherever
          they have access to a computer and the internet. TCS students will
          have the opportunity to work on their projects during class, but we
          love when students work on their projects at home (parental decisions
          about screen time permitting), so you may find them bringing it up in
          conversation with you as they work or even asking for your help.
          Global issues affect all of us, so working together to find solutions
          is expected and encouraged.
      - title: Why Build a Better World?
        mdContent: >-
          It’s no secret that our world changed dramatically in the last year.
          This has been a period of hardship and upheaval, one which has left
          many of us, adults and kids alike, feeling understandably helpless.
          But it’s also been a time of incredible community-driven support and
          creative problem-solving, especially in tech. From students using 3D
          printers to create face shields for healthcare workers to companies
          like Dyson using their engineering expertise to design and produce new
          ventilators, it’s clear that ingenuity and kindness still abound. And
          we at The Coding Space believe that our students can be a part of the
          solution.\

          \

          That’s why we’re empowering our students to put their ideas into action. How can we use code to distribute food to the hungry? To stop future pandemics? To support the pursuit of racial equity? Whether it’s on a local or global level, kids will have the chance to program prototypes of their creative solutions for real issues facing our world.
      - title: How will projects be judged?
        mdContent: All completed projects will be hosted on the TCS website. Voting
          opens on Saturday, May 8th when participants will have the opportunity
          to vote for Coders’ Choice. The TCS team will reveal this winner, as
          well as winners in several technical categories chosen by our TCS
          instructors, during a live virtual event on Sunday, May 16th.
      - title: How can kids get involved?
        mdContent: Participating coders can [sign up
          here](https://www.thecodingspace.com/c4csignup.html) between Monday,
          March 22nd and Sunday, April 11th.
      - title: How can parents help support their C4C coders?
        mdContent: We encourage you to explore the [Sustainable Development
          Goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals) with your children and to engage in
          conversations with them about what those goals are trying to address.
          Check out [this
          resource](https://cecp.co/how-to-talk-to-your-kids-about-the-sustainable-development-goals-sdgs/) about
          discussing SDGs with kids, and think about what goals they may already
          have a passion for or might like to know more about.
