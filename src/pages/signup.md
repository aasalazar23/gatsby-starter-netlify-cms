      ## In-Person Coding Instruction is Back!


      The Coding Space is now safely offering private classes from the comfort
      of your home. Working in small groups, our coding classes balance screen
      time with hands-on activities and opportunities to create and explore. Our
      program is aimed at helping children develop critical thinking skills,
      confidence, and self-expression through learning to code. Our private
      classes also provide our signature 4:1 student to teacher ratio ensuring
      personalized attention when they need it.


      ### How It Works


      * Contact us to create the lesson format best suited to your child.

      * Sign waivers to ensure the safety of all involved.

      * Our teachers come to you. Let the fun begin!
