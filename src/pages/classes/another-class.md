  - title: Project-Based Coding
    content:
      All students learn to code using the Socratic Method, allowing them to
      develop a newfound problem-solving stamina.​​ Beginners code in Scratch, a
      block based programming language created by MIT. Advanced students code in
      JavaScript or other text-based programming languages. Students receive
      personalized attention and curriculum customization through experienced
      teachers and a 4:1 camper-to-counselor ratio. Learn more about our
      educational philosophy.
  - title: Hands-On Activities
    content:
      Students take a break from their screens and discover the opportunities to
      create and explore that exist all around them, even in their own living
      rooms. Centered in the world of STEAM, activities will be derived from the
      fields of engineering, language arts, design, and more.
  - title: Weekly Challenges & Reflection
    content:
      Students will be challenged each week to learn new programming techniques
      and stretch their minds in new ways. Each class ends with a reflection on
      the day's work, lessons learned, and future goals.

## In-Person Coding Instruction is Back!

The Coding Space is now safely offering private classes from the comfort of your
home. Working in small groups, our coding classes balance screen time with
hands-on activities and opportunities to create and explore. Our program is
aimed at helping children develop critical thinking skills, confidence, and
self-expression through learning to code. Our private classes also provide our
signature 4:1 student to teacher ratio ensuring personalized attention when they
need it.

### How It Works
