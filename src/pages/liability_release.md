      On behalf of my son/daughter/ward, I, the parent/guardian, in exchange for the right of my son/daughter/ward to participate in The Coding Space program(s), hereby release The Coding Space, its owners, agents, partners, facility providers and employees from liability (including claims based upon negligence) for any and all damages or injuries to my son/daughter/ward or damage of any personal property. I agree to be fully responsible for any and all such damages or injuries which may result directly or indirectly from any negligent acts or activities associated with The Coding Space. However, I understand that I am not releasing The Coding Space, its owners, agents, partners, facility providers, and employees from gross negligence, reckless conduct or intentionally tortious conduct. To the extent this release conflicts with state/provincial law governing releases, this release is to be given the fullest force and effect permitted under state/provincial law. Should any part of this contract be found invalid or not enforceable by a court of law, then the remaining portion shall continue to be valid and in force.
