    Celebrate your child’s special day with an unforgettable coding experience.

Whether attendees are new to coding or already proficient in programming languages like JavaScript and Python, our interactive, virtual coding parties are fun for everyone. Our experienced instructors balance screen time using our signature 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio with hands-on activities, games, and opportunities to create and explore. Personalize your party by choosing a fun theme, cool activities, STEAM-based subjects, and more. Perfect for groups of 2-12 kids and ages 6-17, our parties keep the celebration going, even from afar.
