      Existing clients ("Referrer") who refer friends and family as new clients
      (“New Client") to The Coding Space, may be eligible to receive referral
      credits (“Credit(s)”).


      Referrers become eligible for The Coding Space Referral and Rewards
      Program after their student has registered for a recurring class or camp.
      Referrer will receive $100 in Credit when New Client purchases their first
      recurring class or camp registration using the Referrer’s unique code
      (“Code”). Referrer will not receive Credit for any subsequent purchase(s)
      made by New Client. Credit amounts will be added to the Referrer's The
      Coding Space account. Referrer will have the opportunity to apply Credits
      at checkout up to the purchase amount.


      New Client is defined as a customer that has not previously registered for
      a recurring class or camp. New Client will receive a 10% off discount
      (“Discount”) when they purchase a new recurring class or camp
      registration. Discount is applicable only on recurring classes or camps,
      defined as those that are not trial or single-session. Discount is
      non-transferrable and cannot be combined with any other discount or
      promotion.


      New Client will be disqualified and will not receive Discount if The
      Coding Space determines that New Client has previously registered under a
      different email address with The Coding Space that is associated with a
      recurring class or camp purchase. The Coding Space reserves the right to
      withhold or invalidate any Discount obtained through the The Coding Space
      Referral and Rewards Program if The Coding Space determines or believes
      that Discount was received through error, fraudulent, illegal, or in
      violation of these terms and conditions or any other applicable agreement
      between you and The Coding Space.


      Referrer Credits cannot be redeemed for cash or cash equivalent. Credits
      are not transferable and may not be auctioned, traded, bartered, or sold.
      Credits may not be retroactively applied to the Referrer’s account.
      Credits may be used in conjunction with up to one other discount or
      promotional code. The Coding Space reserves the right to withhold or
      invalidate Credit obtained through the The Coding Space Referral and
      Rewards Program if The Coding Space determines or believes that the Credit
      was received through error, fraudulent, illegal, or in violation of these
      terms and conditions or any other applicable agreement between you and The
      Coding Space.


      Discounts and Credits are subject to change by The Coding Space at any
      time. Void where restricted or prohibited by law.
