      ## GirlCode Programs


      ### Bridging the Gender Gap in Tech






      Our GirlCode program utilizes the same curriculum as our co-ed classes and is open to anyone looking to learn in a safe and supportive female-identifying space. In these welcoming classes, students develop friendships, have fun, and discover opportunities to tackle new challenges in an inclusive environment.

      ## Teen Programs


      ### Experiential Learning For High School Students




      While every one of our classes is intended for students up to age 17, our teen-only high school programs build on foundational skills with opportunities to take on larger independent projects and develop leadership and mentoring capabilities.
