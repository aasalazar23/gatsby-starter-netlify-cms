      Recent research suggests that nearly 65 percent of today’s kindergartners
      will land in jobs that don’t yet exist, likely in the technology, science,
      and math industries. Yet, as of 2015, [only 18
      percent](https://www.thecodingspace.com/the-coding-space-blog/how-to-encourage-a-love-of-steam-in-girls)
      of graduates with a computer science degree identified as female. Now more
      than ever, we need to close the gender gap in tech by creating
      opportunities for inclusivity.




      The Coding Space is committed to being a part of the solution by providing mentorship, opportunities for growth, and equitable access to girls, women, transgender people, gender non-conforming people, and non-binary people. Our welcoming and inclusive GirlCode program utilizes the same curriculum as our co-ed Beginner and Advanced classes while fostering a safe and supportive female-identifying space for our GirlCoders to develop their computational and critical thinking skills, intellectual confidence, and passion for STEM.
