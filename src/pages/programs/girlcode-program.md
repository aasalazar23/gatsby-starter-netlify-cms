      ## Bridging the Gender Gap in Tech


      Recent research suggests that nearly 65 percent of today’s kindergartners will land in jobs that don’t yet exist, likely in the technology, science, and math industries. Yet, as of 2015, [only 18 percent](/blog/2022-02-08-how-to-encourage-a-love-of-stem-in-girls/) of graduates with a computer science degree identified as female. Now more than ever, we need to close the gender gap in tech by creating opportunities for inclusivity.


      The Coding Space is committed to being a part of the solution by providing mentorship, opportunities for growth, and equitable access. Our welcoming and inclusive GirlCode program utilizes the same curriculum as our co-ed classes while fostering a safe and supportive female-identifying space for our GirlCoders to develop their computational and critical thinking skills, intellectual confidence, and passion for STEM.
