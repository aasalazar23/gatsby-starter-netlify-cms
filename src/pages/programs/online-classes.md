      ## L﻿earn to code from anywhere


      I﻿n our online coding classes, kids and teens learn to code in Scratch, JavaScript, and more, while building key critical thinking and problem solving skills. Unlike virtually all other online classes, our teachers never lecture; instead they ask targeted questions that lead students to figuring out solutions on their own as they code a wide variety of projects. Using multiple screensharing and other specialized Zoom features, teachers are able to see every line of code students write and guide them along the way, providing a personalized and supportive environment in a 4:1 student-to-teacher setting.

          “The Coding Space has opened up a whole new world for our daughter,
          which was especially needed during this time when she couldn’t see
          friends in person. Her Coding Space classes are the highlight of her
          week and it’s so incredible to watch her progress.”

          “I was impressed by how much one-on-one feedback James received from
          his teachers. I really liked the fact that the teachers didn't tell
          him what to do, but rather encouraged him to problem solve on his
          own.”


          —Tricia, NYC


          "The Coding Space is fun to me because they let me make up my own ideas, have fun doing the activities, and then share! I like the feedback that others share with me too! It's a place with a message of fun to me."
