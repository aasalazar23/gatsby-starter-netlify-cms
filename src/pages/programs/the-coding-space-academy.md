      - title: Personalized mentor-facilitated training
        content: High schoolers will meet with their designated mentor multiple times
          each week to set goals and review their progress. Our expert coding
          mentors are trained to give young coders the individualized tools they
          need to achieve their educational and project-specific goals.
      - title: Project playlists
        content: Mentors will guide students through increasingly challenging coding
          projects to continuously build their skills over time. With these
          personalized “project playlists”, students will advance from simple
          tasks to complex projects that require multiple days of focused
          effort.
      - title: Daily reflections
        content: For 15 minutes at the end of each day, TCS Academy coders will reflect
          on their progress, their setbacks, and their goals in their journals.
          This dedicated time for self-reflection is critical for students to
          grow in confidence, skill, and self-awareness.
      - title: Workshops & guest speaker
        content: By interacting with working STEM professionals through workshops and
          Q&As, high schoolers will develop real-life skills and tricks of the
          trade in fields like cybersecurity, electrical engineering, and app
          design.
      - title: Community-building events
        content: Through team lunches, game nights, and collaborative office hours, TCS
          Academy coders will build a community of like-minded code lovers.
      - title: Capstone project
        content: Students’ work will culminate in a final coding capstone project that
          is presented to fellow high schoolers and parents on Demo Day.
