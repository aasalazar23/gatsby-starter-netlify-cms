      # Teen Code


      ### Recommended for ages 14-17, co-ed


      In our Teen Code course held September through June, students will work in several languages depending on their experience. Beginners will learn JavaScript, the language of the web, through creating projects in WoofJS, our JavaScript learning platform. Intermediate coders will learn to build web-based games and applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. More advanced coders will take a deeper dive into advanced JavaScript or work in Python, Java, or another text-based language of their choosing.

      ## STEM Leadership Program


      ## Recommended for ages 14-17, co-ed


      It’s often said that there is no better way to learn than to teach. Similar to a CIT program, this program is designed for teenagers who enjoy helping younger learners and serving as a mentor and role model. After learning our curriculum, our STEM Leadership students join our teacher training program, where they’ll become adept in teaching using the Socratic Method. As they progress, they’ll team up with our expert teachers to lead coding classes for younger students.
