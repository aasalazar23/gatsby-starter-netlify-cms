      ## High School Accelerator


      ### Recommended for ages 14-17, co-ed


      High school students will take a deep dive into programming with a variety of preliminary scaffolds, including instructional support on a sequence of challenge projects. Midway through the course, students will choose open-ended projects that combine the skills they’ve learned to work on for the duration of the semester. They’ll be encouraged to pair up with other students, even if they’re not necessarily at their same level, providing an authentic team setting for students to collaborate and pair-program on software projects of their creation.
