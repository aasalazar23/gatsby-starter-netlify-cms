      ### An Unforgettable Birthday Experience 




      Looking for a totally unique birthday celebration? At The Coding Space, we’re on a mission to help kids develop creative thinking skills, confidence, and self-expression through learning to code. Whether attendees are new to coding or already proficient in programming languages like JavaScript and Python, our interactive, virtual and in-person coding parties are fun for everyone. 




      Our experienced instructors balance coding challenges, using our signature 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio  with hands-on activities, games, and opportunities to create and explore. Personalize your party by choosing a fun theme, cool activities, STEM-based subjects, and more. These events are perfect for ages 6-17.
