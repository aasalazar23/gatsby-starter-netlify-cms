      ### An Unforgettable Birthday Experience 




      Looking for a totally unique birthday celebration? At The Coding Space, we’re on a mission to help kids develop creative thinking skills, confidence, and self-expression through learning to code. Whether attendees are new to coding or already proficient in programming languages like JavaScript and Python, our interactive, virtual and in-person coding parties are fun for everyone. 




      Our experienced instructors balance coding challenges, using our signature 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio  with hands-on activities, games, and opportunities to create and explore. Personalize your party by choosing a fun theme, cool activities, STEM-based subjects, and more. These events are perfect for ages 6-17.

      ### Before the Party


      Virtual parties: Guests will receive instructions on how to sign in, the party theme (see below), and what equipment will be needed. At this time, we recommend Macs and PCs for our online program. If Chromebooks will be used, we ask everyone to let us know ahead of time as it may require extra logistical coordination on our end. Tablets, smartphones, and iPads will not work.




      In-person parties: For in-person celebrations, please contact us for more information.


      ### Warm-Up Activity


      On the day of, we kick-off with a warm-up activity like Price is Right or Cool Hidden Talents.


      ### Project-Based Coding


      Next, we launch into project-based coding time with our instructors there to guide and prompt problem solving.


      ### Hands-On, Off-Screen Activity


      Then kids take a break, reset, and recharge with a screen-free, hands-on activity. Personalize your party by selecting from options like Become a Painting, Themed Yoga, The Coding Space Cooks, Guided Dance, Design Your Own Board Game, or Scavenger Hunt.


      ### Elective


      Next, we’ll dive into a STEM-based subject that encourages exploration and discovery, with awesome choices kids can pick from like Graphic Design, Font Making, Music Sequencing, 3D Printing, and more.


      ### Wrap-Up


      We wrap up with a fun reflection and a chance to sing Happy Birthday! If you’ve provided a cake, this would be the perfect time to light the candles, sing, and serve.


      #### Optional Party Theme


      Prior to the party, the birthday child may select a theme for the event. Pick from favorites like pajama day, backwards day, time travel day, wilderness day, beach day, mustache day, and many others.
