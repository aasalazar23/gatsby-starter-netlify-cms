      ## Girl Scouts Workshops


      ### Gather the Troops


      Our Girl Scouts Program empowers kids to take STEM by storm. Available in person and online, these inclusive workshops introduce programming skills and fascinating STEM subjects. Workshops consist of a warm-up activity, project-based learning, and reflection, and conclude with a special badge ceremony.




      These 90-minute workshops are ideal for ages 6-17.
