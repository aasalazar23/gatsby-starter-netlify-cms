      ## Girl Scouts Workshops


      ### Gather the Troops


      Our Girl Scouts Program empowers kids to take STEM by storm. Available in person and online, these inclusive workshops introduce programming skills and fascinating STEM subjects. Workshops consist of a warm-up activity, project-based learning, and reflection, and conclude with a special badge ceremony.




      These 90-minute workshops are ideal for ages 6-17.

      ## Not Your Typical Coding Class


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.
