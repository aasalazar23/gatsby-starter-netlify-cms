      ### A Space for Growth


      We guarantee individual attention and a custom learning experience for
      each student with a 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio.


      ### Personalized Learning


      We’re not your typical coding class. Our classes are designed to foster
      intellectual confidence, growth mindset and computational thinking skills.


      ### Expert Teachers


      Our teachers create a welcoming and engaging learning environment for
      students. Our teachers never lecture. We believe in asking specific
      questions to help students solve problems.
