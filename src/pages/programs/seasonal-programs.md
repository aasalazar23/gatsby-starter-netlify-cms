      - title: Project-Based Coding
        content: We challenge our students to create projects as unique as they are.
          Students receive individualized attention and curriculum customization
          through experienced teachers and a 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio. Using
          the Socratic method, our teachers ask questions aimed at helping
          students discover their own solutions to problems. Whether your child
          is new to coding or already building their own websites and projects,
          our classes allow students to progress through our curriculum at the
          pace that’s right for them.
      - title: Hands-On Activities
        content: Students take a break from their screens and discover the opportunities
          to create and explore that exist all around them, even in their own
          living rooms. Centered in the world of STEM, these activities draw on
          skills found in engineering, language arts, design, and more. These
          opportunities support cognitive, emotional, and social development,
          allowing students to grow in fun new ways.
      - title: Weekly Challenges & Reflection
        content: Each week, students are challenged to learn new programming techniques
          and stretch their minds in fresh, interesting ways. Each class ends
          with a reflection on the day's work, lessons learned, and future
          goals.
