      ## STEMoween: A STEM Halloween Extravaganza


      Mark your calendars this October because we're bringing the spookiness to STEM. Visit us on Saturday, October 21st in Park Slope or on Halloween evening on the Upper East Side and get ready for LED Jack-o'-lanterns, candy chemistry, and Witch's Brew Slime. And of course, nerds and smarties will be our candy of choice because we're all about that brainy sweetness! 🎃🧪🍬
