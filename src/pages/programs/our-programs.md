      ## Seasonal Programs


      Our spring, summer, and fall classes bring students together each week to make progress on individual projects, dive into hands-on activities, and explore opportunities for self-expression. By challenging students at their individual level to create projects as unique as they are, we underscore the power of personalized learning. And with our 4:1 student-to-teacher ratio, students get the guidance they need to keep moving forward. Learn more about each semester by clicking below.
