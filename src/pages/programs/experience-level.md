      ## **Experience Levels**


      Whether your child is new to coding or already building their own games
      and websites, our coding classes will promote their growth within a safe,
      supportive environment. By challenging students at their individual level
      to create projects as unique as they are, we underscore the power of
      personalized learning. 


      While our classes are tailored to each of the four experience levels
      below, our student-centered approach creates a fully personalized
      education experience, allowing students to be challenged at their
      individual level and pace. No matter where they’ve started, we’re here to
      help them get where they want to go.

          ## Young Beginner Code


          #### Ages 6-8, co-ed


          For young and first-time coders, we focus on fostering a welcoming and
          creative learning environment where students will develop a fluency
          with technology and start forming crucial computational thinking
          patterns. Students learn through specially curated activities in
          Code.org and ScratchJr, and advance into building animations and games
          in Scratch, a block-based programming language developed by MIT.

          ## **Beginner** Code


          #### Ages 8-14, co-ed


          In our Beginner course, we use Scratch challenge projects as our core
          curriculum. By starting in Scratch, a block-based coding language, we
          skip over the small syntactic details of text-based languages and cut
          directly to the difficult part of coding: formulating one’s ideas into
          a logical sequence of steps. Students can jump into this class with no
          prior programming knowledge and in just a few hours build a
          foundational understanding of core computer science concepts through
          building games and animations. As they progress through this course,
          they’ll continue to learn essential programming constructs and develop
          a computational thought process that will prepare them for more
          advanced material.

          ## **Intermediate**


          #### Ages 8-14, co-ed


          In our Intermediate course, students will create advanced projects in
          Scratch, a block-based coding language and move onto text-based
          programming in WoofJS, our JavaScript learning platform. WoofJS was
          developed by The Coding Space to allow students to leverage their
          existing Scratch knowledge and transition naturally into using HTML,
          CSS, and JavaScript to make web-based projects. Students should come
          in with an advanced understanding of Scratch.

          ## **Advanced Code**


          #### Ages 8-14, co-ed


          In our Advanced course, students will learn JavaScript, the language
          of the web, through creating advanced projects in WoofJS, our
          JavaScript learning platform, and web-based games, animations, and
          applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As students grow their
          skills, they’ll rely less and less on our curricular guide rails and
          move towards self-directed learning where they’ll work with front-end
          and back-end technologies, experimenting with new languages like
          Python or Java to bring their ideas to fruition. Students should come
          in with experience in JavaScript or other text-based languages.

          # Teen Code


          **Ages 14-17, co-ed**


          In our Teen Code course, students will work in several languages
          depending on their experience. Beginners will learn JavaScript, the
          language of the web, through creating projects in WoofJS, our
          JavaScript learning platform. Intermediate coders will learn to build
          web-based games and applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. More
          advanced coders will take a deeper dive into advanced JavaScript or
          work in Python, Java, or another text-based language of their
          choosing.
