          ## Young Beginner Code


          #### Ages 6-8, co-ed


          For young and first-time coders, we focus on fostering a welcoming and creative learning environment where students will develop digital literacy and start formulating crucial computational thinking patterns. Students learn through specially curated activities in Code.org and additional platforms as needed and advance into building animations and games in Scratch, a block-based programming language developed by MIT.

          ## **Beginner** Code


          #### Ages 8-13, co-ed


          In our Beginner course, we use Scratch challenge projects as our core curriculum. By starting in Scratch, a block-based coding language, we skip over the small syntactic details of text-based languages and cut directly to the difficult part of coding: formulating one’s ideas into a logical sequence of steps. Students can jump into this class with no prior programming knowledge and in just a few hours build a foundational understanding of core computer science concepts through building games and animations. As they progress through this course, they’ll continue to learn essential programming constructs and develop a computational thought process that will prepare them for more advanced material.

          ## **Intermediate**


          #### Ages 8-13, co-ed


          In our Intermediate course, students will create advanced projects in Scratch, a block-based coding language and move onto text-based programming in WoofJS, our JavaScript learning platform. WoofJS was developed by The Coding Space to allow students to leverage their existing Scratch knowledge and transition naturally into using JavaScript to make advanced projects. Students should come in with an advanced understanding of Scratch.

          ### Python Module: Building Your Child's CS Muscles


          In the Python segment, students will transition to this versatile language, known for  its extensive application in AI and data science  – fields that are shaping our future.


          They'll start by building simple yet engaging games like Rock, Scissors, Paper and Guess the Number, which are perfect for understanding Python's basics. But it doesn't end there. The course dives into graphical game development using Pygame, allowing students to create more visually engaging and complex games. They'll also tackle real-world problems using algorithms, manage data and files efficiently, and explore the realms of object-oriented programming. 


          **Your Journey to Advanced Skills**


          Students will emerge from this course with a profound understanding of how to harness the power of code to bring ideas to life. We require that students come with a background in JavaScript, Python, or a similar text-based language. This ensures they are ready for the transformative journey that our Advanced Programming course offers, setting them on a path to become skilled, creative, and versatile programmers and thinkers.
