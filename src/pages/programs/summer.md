      ## Not Your Typical Coding Class


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

      Our highly trained teachers are able to instruct students with a range of abilities and skills levels: from complete beginners to students already building applications in JavaScript and Python.
