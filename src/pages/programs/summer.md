      ## Not Your Typical Coding Experience


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

      ##  Scholarships Available


      We believe that everyone has a right to equitable education in a safe and inclusive learning environment and are committed to increasing access to our high quality coding programs. Our scholarship program accounts for 25 percent of the students we teach. Our long-term goal as we work towards educational equity is to reach 50 percent of our students through at-cost and pro-bono services.
