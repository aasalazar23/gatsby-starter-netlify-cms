      ## Not Your Typical Coding Experience


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive
      learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover
      their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted
      questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem
      solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational
      thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and
      independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers,
      learners, and leaders.

      ##  Scholarships Available
