  description:
    At The Coding Space, we know the impact learning to code can have on any
    student of any age. It teaches us how to think critically and learn better.
    It reminds us that lightbulb moments are often preceded by moments of
    feeling stuck. It lets us be creative, express ourselves, make things that
    we're proud of, and have fun!
