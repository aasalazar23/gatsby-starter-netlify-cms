      ## Not Your Typical Coding Camp


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

      ## T﻿he Tech Olympics


      Designed to inspire young innovators to use their ingenuity, creativity, and leadership skills to build, create, and invent, The Lift-Off Lab gives campers the opportunity to explore robotics, circuitry, animation, 3D modeling, and more on camp afternoons. Our experienced instructors will guide campers through the engineering design process, providing support and guidance every step of the way, as well as engage them in important real-world discussions like how their invention could be used for good or how AI and machine learning could influence what they create.


      At The Coding Space we believe that creativity, innovation, and collaboration are essential skills for the future. That's why we're dedicated to providing a space where young people can develop these skills and explore their interests in fun and engaging ways all summer long.

      - title: My son loved every minute of camp. The counselors were super fun,
          patient, and the program was smart and engaging. The camp also does a
          tech pre-check the day before to ensure the best experience.
        content: Kerri, NYC
      - title: The Coding Space is fun to me because they let me make up my own ideas,
          have fun doing the activities, and then share! It's a place with a
          message of fun to me.
        content: Ellery, Brooklyn
      - title: I was impressed by how much one-on-one feedback James received. I really
          liked the fact that the camp counselors didn't tell him what to do,
          but rather encouraged him to problem solve on his own.
