      ## Not Your Typical Coding Camp


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

      - title: My son loved every minute of camp. The counselors were super fun,
          patient, and the program was smart and engaging. The camp also does a
          tech pre-check the day before to ensure the best experience.
        content: Kerri, NYC
      - title: The Coding Space is fun to me because they let me make up my own ideas,
          have fun doing the activities, and then share! It's a place with a
          message of fun to me.
        content: Ellery, Brooklyn
      - title: I was impressed by how much one-on-one feedback James received. I really
          liked the fact that the camp counselors didn't tell him what to do,
          but rather encouraged him to problem solve on his own.
