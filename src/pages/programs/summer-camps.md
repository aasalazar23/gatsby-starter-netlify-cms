      ## Not Your Typical Coding Camp


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

              Students receive individualized attention and curriculum
              customization through experienced teachers and a 4:1
              student-to-teacher ratio. Using the Socratic method, our teachers
              ask questions aimed at helping students discover their own
              solutions to problems. Whether your child is new to coding or
              already building their own websites and projects, students
              progress through our curriculum at the pace that’s right for them.

              activities range from short story writing and yoga to cryptography
              and science experiments, and much more. These opportunities
              support cognitive, emotional, and social development, allowing
              students to grow in new ways.

      ### Coders Who Care


      At The Coding Space, we are passionate about creating a space for campers to dream big and see how technology can be a tool for changing the world.


      One of our key programs is the Code for Change Challenge. Each summer, campers learn about one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and work on developing a technology solution to tackle this global issue.


      This summer campers will have the opportunity to build projects around an SDG they'd like to tackle and present it to the camp at the end of the week.

      ### Don't Miss a Special Two Weeks of GirlCode!


      ## Why all girls camp?


      Only 20% of tech jobs are held by women.


      Male dominated coding classes could be an intimidating way to start learning to code.


      By creating a welcoming and inclusive environment for girls to learn to code, we can help change the gender gap in tech.

      ##  Scholarships Available


      We believe that everyone has a right to equitable education in a safe and inclusive learning environment and are committed to increasing access to our high quality coding programs. Our scholarship program accounts for 25 percent of the students we teach. Our long-term goal as we work towards educational equity is to reach 50 percent of our students through at-cost and pro-bono services.

    list:
      - title: My son loved every minute of camp. The counselors were super fun,
          patient, and the program was smart and engaging. The camp also does a
          tech pre-check the day before to ensure the best experience.
        content: Kerri, NYC
      - title: The Coding Space is fun to me because they let me make up my own ideas,
          have fun doing the activities, and then share! It's a place with a
          message of fun to me.
        content: Ellery, Brooklyn
      - title: I was impressed by how much one-on-one feedback James received. I really
          liked the fact that the camp counselors didn't tell him what to do,
          but rather encouraged him to problem solve on his own.
