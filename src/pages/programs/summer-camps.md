      ## Not Your Typical Coding Class


      At The Coding Space, we specialize in providing a safe and inclusive learning environment for kids to have fun, be challenged, and discover their passions. Our teachers never lecture; instead, they ask targeted questions using the Socratic Method to get students thinking and problem solving on their own. By focusing on the development of computational thinking skills, intellectual confidence, self-expression, and independence, our students learn to code while growing as thinkers, learners, and leaders.

      ## Class Options 


      Our highly trained teachers are able to instruct students with a range of abilities and skills levels: from complete beginners to students already building applications in JavaScript and Python. Choose from two weekly classes and a variety of skill levels. For added scheduling flexibility, half-semester options are also available.

          - title: Class Kickoff & Challenges
            content: Each week, students are challenged to learn new programming techniques
              and stretch their minds in fresh, interesting ways. We'll kick off
              each class with a warm welcome and ideas and inspiration for new
              challenges to tackle.
          - title: Project-Based Coding
            content: We challenge our students to create projects as unique as they are.
              Students receive individualized attention and curriculum
              customization through experienced teachers and a 4:1
              student-to-teacher ratio. Using the Socratic method, our teachers
              ask questions aimed at helping students discover their own
              solutions to problems. Whether your child is new to coding or
              already building their own websites and projects, students
              progress through our curriculum at the pace that’s right for them.
          - title: Hands-On Activities
            content: Time to stretch, tinker, and play. Students take a break from their
              screens and discover the opportunities to create and explore that
              exist all around them, even in their own living rooms. Centered in
              the world of STEM, these activities range from short story writing
              and yoga to virtual escape rooms, cryptography, and much more.
              These opportunities, offered in classes longer than 1.5 hours,
              support cognitive, emotional, and social development, allowing
              students to grow in fun new ways.
          - title: Reflection
            content: >
              Each class ends with a reflection on the day's work, lessons
              learned, and future goals.

      - title: My son loved every minute of camp. The counselors were super fun,
          patient, and the program was smart and engaging. The camp also does a
          tech pre-check the day before to ensure the best experience.
        content: Kerri, NYC
      - title: The Coding Space is fun to me because they let me make up my own ideas,
          have fun doing the activities, and then share! It's a place with a
          message of fun to me.
        content: Ellery, Brooklyn
      - title: I was impressed by how much one-on-one feedback James received. I really
          liked the fact that the camp counselors didn't tell him what to do,
          but rather encouraged him to problem solve on his own.
