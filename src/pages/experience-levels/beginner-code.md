  mdContent: "In our Beginner course, we use Scratch challenge projects as our
    core curriculum. By starting in Scratch, a block-based coding language, we
    skip over the small syntactic details of text-based languages and cut
    directly to the difficult part of coding: formulating one’s ideas into a
    logical sequence of steps. Students can jump into this class with no prior
    programming knowledge and in just a few hours build a foundational
    understanding of core computer science concepts through building games and
    animations. As they progress through this course, they’ll continue to learn
    essential programming constructs and develop a computational thought process
    that will prepare them for more advanced material."
