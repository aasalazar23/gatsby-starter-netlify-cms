  mdContent: In our Advanced course, students will learn JavaScript, the language
    of the web, through creating advanced projects in WoofJS, our JavaScript
    learning platform, and web-based games, animations, and applications in
    JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. As students grow their skills, they’ll rely less
    and less on our curricular guide rails and move towards self-directed
    learning where they’ll work with front-end and back-end technologies,
    experimenting with new languages and platforms including Python to bring
    their ideas to fruition. Students should come in with experience in
    JavaScript or other text-based languages.
