  mdContent: In this class, students will learn JavaScript, the language of the
    web, through the WoofJS framework. WoofJS was developed by The Coding Space
    to allow students to leverage their existing Scratch knowledge and
    transition naturally into using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make web-based
    projects. Students should come in with an advanced understanding of Scratch
    and/or experience with JavaScript or other text-based languages. They will
    be placed in advanced Scratch, WoofJS, or Web depending on the experience
    they bring in and advance towards building web-based games, animations, and
    applications. As students grow their skills, they’ll rely less and less on
    our curricular guide rails and move towards self-directed learning where
    they’ll work with front-end and back-end technologies, experimenting with
    new languages and platforms to bring their ideas to fruition.
