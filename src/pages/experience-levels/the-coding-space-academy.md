  mdContent: In our pre-college program, high schoolers will be immersed in the
    world of computer science through project-based coding that they’ll
    co-create with expert mentors, learn from STEM professionals, engage in
    educational workshops, take a college tour, and visit a tech company. At the
    end of the two weeks, students will showcase a capstone project on demo day
    that they'll have created in JavaScript, Python, or another programming
    language of their choosing.
