    The Coding Space Academy is a two-week in-person coding intensive for rising
    9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th graders. In this rigorous pre-college program,
    coding novices and experienced programmers alike will pick up the hard
    skills of coding, dive into the professional and collegiate world of
    computer science, test their limits, make friends, and be treated like the
    young adults that they are — all in an immersive boot camp setting.






    The program's features include:


    * **Personalized mentor-facilitated training.** High schoolers will meet with their designated mentor multiple times each week to set goals and review their progress. Our expert coding mentors are trained to give young coders the individualized tools they need to achieve their educational and project-specific goals.

    * **Project playlists.** Mentors will guide students through increasingly challenging coding projects to continuously build their skills over time. With these personalized “project playlists”, students will advance from simple tasks to complex projects that require multiple days of focused effort.

    * **Daily reflections.** For 15 minutes at the end of each day, TCS Academy coders will reflect on their progress, their setbacks, and their goals in their journals. This dedicated time for self-reflection is critical for students to grow in confidence, skill, and self-awareness.

    * **Workshops & guest speakers**. By interacting with working STEM professionals through workshops and Q&As, high schoolers will develop real-life skills and tricks of the trade in fields like cybersecurity, electrical engineering, and app design.

    * **Community-building events.** Through team lunches, game nights, and collaborative office hours, TCS Academy coders will build a community of like-minded code lovers.

    * **Capstone project.** Students’ work will culminate in a final coding capstone project that is presented to fellow high schoolers and parents on Demo Day.
