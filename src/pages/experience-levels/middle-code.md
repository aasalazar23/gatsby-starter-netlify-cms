  mdContent: In our Middle Code classes, students ages 11-14 will learn to code in
    JavaScript and other text-based languages. New coders will learn JavaScript
    in WoofJS, a platform developed by The Coding Space that helps students
    transition from block-based coding languages. More advanced coders will
    tackle web development in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As students continue to
    advance, they’ll explore other professional languages including Python as
    well as learn to integrate key software components such as API’s and
    databases.
