  mdContent: In our Intermediate course, students will create advanced projects in
    Scratch, a block-based coding language, and move onto text-based programming
    in WoofJS, our JavaScript learning platform. WoofJS was developed by The
    Coding Space to allow students to leverage their existing Scratch knowledge
    and transition naturally into using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make
    web-based projects. Students should come in with an advanced understanding
    of Scratch.
