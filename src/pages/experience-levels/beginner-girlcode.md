    Our welcoming and inclusive GirlCode program utilizes the same curriculum as
    our co-ed Beginner class while fostering a safe and supportive
    female-identifying space for our GirlCoders to develop their computational
    and critical thinking skills, intellectual confidence, and passion for STEM.

    Students can jump into this class with little or no prior programming knowledge. As they progress through this course, they’ll learn essential programming constructs and develop a computational thought process that will prepare them for more advanced material. When they’re ready, students will transition into text-based programming through WoofJS, our JavaScript learning platform.
