    For young and first-time coders, we focus on fostering a welcoming and
    creative learning environment where students will develop a fluency with
    technology and start formulating crucial computational thinking patterns as
    they piece together their first lines of code. Students learn through
    specially curated activities in Code.org and advance into building
    animations and games in Scratch, a block-based programming language
    developed by MIT.
