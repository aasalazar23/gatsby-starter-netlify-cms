title: Young Beginner Code
seo_description: Young Beginner students (ages 6-8, co-ed) will develop typing
  and motor skills, expand their reading comprehension abilities, and start
  forming crucial computational thinking patterns as they piece together their
  first lines of code through Code.org before advancing into Scratch.

    ## In-Person Coding Instruction is Back!

    For young and first-time coders, we focus on fostering a welcoming and creative learning environment where students become better oriented with how a computer works, develop advanced coordination, typing, and motor skills as they practice using the mouse and keyboard, build their reading comprehension by following along written instructions, and start forming crucial computational thinking patterns as they piece together their first lines of code. Students learn through specially curated activities in Code.org, a nonprofit organization dedicated to building computer science enrichment activities, and advance into building animations and games in Scratch, a block-based programming language developed by MIT.

    We balance project-based coding with hands-on activities and weekly challenges that help students learn on and off-screen. During each class, students get a break from their screens and discover opportunities to create and explore all around them with activities such as: engineering challenges, science experiments, short story writing, and more.
