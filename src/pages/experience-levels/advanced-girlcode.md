    Our welcoming and inclusive GirlCode program utilizes the same curriculum as
    our co-ed Advanced class while fostering a safe and supportive
    female-identifying space for our GirlCoders to develop their computational
    and critical thinking skills, intellectual confidence, and passion for STEM.

    In our Advanced course, students embark on an exciting journey through the worlds of JavaScript and Python, two cornerstone languages in modern programming. They'll unleash their creativity in JavaScript by building interactive web applications, such as calculators and quizzes, and delve into game development with HTML Canvas. This exploration paves the way for understanding how dynamic web content works. In our Python module, they'll develop their skills by creating engaging games and tackling projects that lay the groundwork for future pursuits in AI and data science. Through these experiences, students will master vital programming concepts, including algorithms, data handling, and object-oriented programming, equipping them with the tools to bring innovative ideas to life.
