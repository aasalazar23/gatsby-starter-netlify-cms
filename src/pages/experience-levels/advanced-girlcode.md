    Our welcoming and inclusive GirlCode program utilizes the same curriculum as
    our co-ed Advanced class while fostering a safe and supportive
    female-identifying space for our GirlCoders to develop their computational
    and critical thinking skills, intellectual confidence, and passion for STEM.

    Students should come in with an advanced understanding of Scratch and/or experience with JavaScript or other text-based languages. They will be placed in advanced Scratch, WoofJS, or Web depending on the experience they bring in and advance towards building web-based games, animations, and applications. As students grow their skills, they’ll rely less and less on our curricular guide rails and move towards self-directed learning where they’ll work with front-end and back-end technologies, experimenting with new languages and platforms to bring their ideas to fruition.
