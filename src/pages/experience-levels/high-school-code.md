    High school students will take a deep dive into programming in our High
    School program. They’ll start off with a variety of preliminary scaffolds,
    including instructional support on a sequence of challenge projects. Midway
    through the course, students will choose open-ended projects that combine
    the skills they’ve learned to work on for the duration of the semester.
    They’ll be encouraged to pair up with other students, even if they’re not
    necessarily at their same level, providing an authentic team setting for
    students to collaborate and pair-program on software projects of their
    creation.


    We balance project-based coding with hands-on activities and weekly challenges that help students learn on and off-screen. During each class, students get a break from their screens and discover opportunities to create and explore all around them with activities such as: engineering challenges, science experiments, short story writing, and more.
