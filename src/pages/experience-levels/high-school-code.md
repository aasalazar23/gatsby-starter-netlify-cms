  mdContent:
    High School students will take a deep dive into programming in our High
    School accelerator program. They’ll start off with instructional support on
    a sequence of challenge projects. Midway through the course, students will
    choose open-ended projects that combine the skills they’ve learned to work
    on for the duration of the semester. They’ll be encouraged to pair up with
    other students, providing an authentic team setting for students to
    collaborate and pair-program on software projects of their creation.
